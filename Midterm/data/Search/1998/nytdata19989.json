Directed by Steven Spielberg (R, 150 minutes). Irrefutably worthy in its attention to a long-overlooked chapter in American history, this story of a slave mutiny and subsequent trial is still a film whose zestiest character is John Quincy Adams (played by Mr. Hopkins). It has great earnestness, impeccable credentials and Mr. Spielberg's great storytelling power. What it lacks is an Oskar Schindler, a flawed, three-dimensional character through whom the atrocity of slavery can be understood. The best moments in this long, instructive tale are those that simply bring the slaves' pride, fear and outrage to life.
