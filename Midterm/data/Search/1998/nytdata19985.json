''He was a tall man in his forties,'' the extravagant narrative informs us, ''so big in the chest and broad in the shoulder that his fellows on the bench seat had felt the strain of his presence, but what his occupation was, or what he planned to do in London, they had not the least idea.'' What Jack Maggs does in London is curious. He makes his way to Great Queen Street and knocks on the door of No. 27, ''rap-rap-rap,'' excited to behold this property at long last. When the maid from next door appears, tells him that the resident of 27 has gone away and asks him if by chance he's the new footman, Maggs announces that yes, he is a footman, and at once accepts a position as such in her household.", "abstract": "Christopher Lehmann-Haupt reviews Peter Carey novel, Jack Maggs; photo (M)", "print_page": "12", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Confounding Expectations Great and Small", "kicker": "BOOKS OF THE TIMES"}, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "JACK MAGGS (BOOK)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "CAREY, PETER"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BOOKS AND LITERATURE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION"}], "pub_date": "1998-02-12T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "The Arts/Cultural Desk", "section_name": "Arts; Books", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Christopher", "rank": 1, "lastname": "LEHMANN-HAUPT"}], "original": "By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT"}, "type_of_material": "Review", "_id": "4fd209238eb7c8105d774ac5", "word_count": 971, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/11/opinion/the-only-good-hero.html", "snippet": "The great mystery of the winter movie season is what makes ''Titanic'' so popular.

True, it was nominated for 14 Academy Awards yesterday, tied for the most ever. But the film is very long, the subject is literally a downer. Its best-known star, Leonardo DiCaprio, is a household name mainly in households that contain prepubescent girls. But ''Titanic'' could wind up becoming the biggest money-making movie in history. We have a suspicion about what makes this old story seem so fresh, but readers who have not yet seen the movie should be warned not to go farther. ''Titanic'' reintroduces an element long missing from Hollywood screenplays -- the dead hero.
