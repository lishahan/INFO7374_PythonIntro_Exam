Quigley Publishing Company, which has produced the International Motion Picture Almanac for 64 years, released the results of its annual Top 10 Moneymaking Stars poll. Among this poll's top 10 stars of 1997, only two, Jack Nicholson (for ''As Good as It Gets'') and Robin Williams (for ''Good Will Hunting''), also received Oscar nominations. The poll, conducted since 1932, asks several hundred motion-picture theater owners in the United States and Canada to name the actors responsible for bringing in the most dollars at the box office in the previous year. This time around, as usual, it provides a fascinating glimpse into how the exhibiting arm of the movie industry views stars.
