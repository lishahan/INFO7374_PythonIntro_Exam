A maestro very much in motion, he'll be at Avery Fisher Hall tomorrow, Friday and Saturday, as well as on Feb. 3, to lead the New York Philharmonic in performances of Bruckner's Symphony No. 8. This is his first appearance in eight years as guest conductor of the Philharmonic. Mr. Eschenbach, who began his career as a pianist, has been music director of the Houston Symphony since 1988 and music director of the Ravinia Festival since 1994. At the end of next season, he is scheduled to lay down his baton in Houston and assume directorship of the Hamburg NDR Symphony Orchestra while becoming artistic director of the Schleswig-Holstein Music Festival. In the Running For those who like to match wits with the experts, here's the early line on the best-director sweepstakes at this year's Academy Awards. The Directors Guild of America, whose prize winner has prefigured the winner of the Oscar for best director all but four times since the organization's first presentation in 1949, has made its nominations: James Cameron for ''Titanic,'' Steven Spielberg for ''Amistad,'' James L. Brooks for ''As Good as It Gets,'' Curtis Hanson for ''L.A. Confidential'' and Gus Van Sant for ''Good Will Hunting.'' The Directors Guild award will be presented in New York and Los Angeles on March 7. And speaking of the Academy Award ceremony, which is scheduled for March 23: Oscar is finally going to get his own theme music, performed by an 83-piece orchestra. It's ''Fanfare for Oscar,'' composed by Jerry Goldsmith, himself an Oscar winner in 1977 for the score of ''The Omen.'' Calling the assignment a ''daunting challenge,'' Mr. Goldsmith added, ''The end result of the 45-second composition is a melding of the Hollywood of the past, the Hollywood of the present and the Hollywood of the future.'' Flight Plan Bertolt Brecht and the American director Robert Wilson will be the guiding spirits when Charles A. Lindbergh flies again, tonight in Berlin in a Berliner Ensemble production commemorating the centennial of Brecht's birth. The production, adapted and staged by Mr. Wilson for the theater founded by Brecht, is derived from ''Der Ozeanflug,'' written by Brecht as a radio play in 1928. The work traces Lindbergh's historic nonstop solo flight from New York to Paris the previous year. Brecht was born on Feb. 10, 1898, and died in East Berlin in 1956. For a Cause With Ron Rifkin (of ''Cabaret''), Adam Alexi-Malle (''Goose-Pimples'') and David Margulies (''Bashevis'') in leading roles, the American premiere reading of ''Look, Europe!'' was presented on Monday night at the Actors Studio. The drama, written by a London-based Iranian playwright, Ghazi Rabihavi, was inspired by the case of an Iranian editor, Faraj Sarkuhi, who was arrested on Jan. 27, 1997, and sentenced to a year in prison on charges of espionage and ''slandering the Islamic Republic.'' Mr. Sarkuhi was among 134 writers who signed a petition in 1994 calling for greater freedom of expression. The reading was sponsored by PEN and the Actors Studio.

Then, of course, they don't commit sins of the flesh. So it's pretty fresh. THE preceding words were brought to you by Stephen Sondheim, as daring a composer-lyricist as the New York musical theater has produced. Who else but Mr. Sondheim would turn a meditation on cannibalism into an urbane Act One finale? The song, ''A Little Priest,'' was shocking only in its breathtaking expression of Mr. Sondheim's boundless (albeit dark and stormy) imagination. When I first heard it, at a matinee of ''Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street'' at the Uris (now the Gershwin) Theater in 1979, I went into a kind of ecstatic stupor. The rhymes fell so lightly on the ear; common phrases were arranged in arresting new juxtapositions. The number is a variation on what songwriters call a ''list song,'' in which a series of refrains reiterates one idea with multiple examples. In this case, it is the plans by Sweeney Todd, a homicidal barber (originally played by a wild-eyed Len Cariou), and Mrs. Lovett, the proprietress of a failing London pie shop (an angelically malicious Angela Lansbury), to slit the throats of his customers and bake them into meat pies. The cleverest song of its kind since Cole Porter's ''Let's Do It,'' in 1928, ''A Little Priest'' was just one example of Mr. Sondheim at the pinnacle of his powers. ''Sweeney Todd,'' which opened March 1, 1979, capped a decade of extraordinary musicals by the Manhattan-born composer. It began in 1970 with ''Company,'' his paean to neurotic New York relationships, and continued with the ravishing ''Follies'' (1971), the droll ''A Little Night Music'' (1973) and the cerebral (and underappreciated) ''Pacific Overtures'' (1976). By the time ''Sweeney Todd'' came to Broadway three years later, Mr. Sondheim had established himself as poet laureate of the musical theater, an artist and craftsman whose polished rhymes elevated lyric writing to a higher plane. Mr. Sondheim's career is also something of a lasting tribute to the great Broadway songwriters who preceded him, many of whom he consciously evokes in his scores. In the past, masters like Frank Loesser, Lerner and Loewe and Rodgers and Hart dominated Broadway in much the same way. And as both inheritor of the mantle of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d, at whose knee he learned his craft, and the composer most emulated by a generation of younger musical writers, Mr. Sondheim is the vital link between old forms and new. This turns out to be a mixed blessing, for many of those who have tried to follow his lead have proved to be only pale imitations. He is also the quintessential New York man of the theater, a home-grown talent in a home-grown industry. Many of his musicals, including ''Company,'' ''Follies,'' ''Merrily We Roll Along'' and the Pulitzer Prize-winning ''Sunday in the Park With George,'' portray New York types, mores and customs. Even ''Sweeney Todd,'' though it takes place in grimy, Hogarthian London, is infused with New York attitude: how else to describe Mrs. Lovett's brainstorm of turning corpses into munchies than as an example of the pragmatic New York-style seizing of a business opportunity? From the screeching factory whistle that prefaced the opening number to the grisly denouement, in which Mrs. Lovett was consigned by the demon barber to her own oven, the Grand Guignol-inspired ''Sweeney Todd'' was among the most unsettling musicals ever staged. The piercingly beautiful melodies, like ''Pretty Women'' and ''Green Finch and Linnet Bird,'' were ornate ruses, equal parts sugar and melancholy. The entire production, directed by Mr. Sondheim's longtime collaborator, Harold Prince, and designed by Eugene Lee to resemble a Victorian house of horrors, seemed perfumed with the sickly sweet odor of a slow-acting, poisonous gas. That was a key to its artistic success. Here was a musical that was not afraid to draw blood. Even lighthearted moments were underscored in the discordant tones of deep distress: an overwhelming sense of doom engulfed the audience the moment the lights went down. Though it won eight Tony Awards, including best musical, ''Sweeney Todd'' was not a hit on the order of mega-musicals like ''Cats'' and ''The Phantom of the Opera'' that would follow in the 1980's, the Andrew Lloyd Webber Decade for Broadway. ''Sweeney'' closed after 557 performances. But for me and, I suspect, many other theatergoers, that production is an abiding cultural landmark. It was a theater experience that had the power to make you swoon, as fixed in the memory as any Broadway playhouse is anchored to midtown bedrock.", "abstract": "Peter Marks tribute to Stephen Sondheim, homegrown New York theater talent whose musicals include Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street; photo of 1979 production with Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury; list of longest-running Broadway shows (S)", "print_page": "24", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Home-Grown Musical Master"}, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "SWEENEY TODD (PLAY)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "LANSBURY, ANGELA"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "CARIOU, LEN"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "SONDHEIM, STEPHEN"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "NEW YORK CITY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HISTORY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "THEATER"}], "pub_date": "1998-01-25T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Then & Now", "section_name": "Theater", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Peter", "rank": 1, "lastname": "MARKS"}], "original": "By PETER MARKS"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd1f7ca8eb7c8105d753419", "word_count": 770, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/25/classified/paid-notice-deaths-schonfeld-moses.html", "snippet": "SCHONFELD-Moses.
