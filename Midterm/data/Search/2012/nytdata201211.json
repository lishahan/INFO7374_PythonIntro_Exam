(Showtime) THE TEMPEST (2010) Prospera (Helen Mirren, above), a vengeful sorceress, unleashes her powers against shipwrecked enemies in this adaptation of Shakespeare's drama by Julie Taymor, the director of the ''The Lion King'' on Broadway and the former director of the Broadway musical ''Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark.'' Felicity Jones plays Miranda, Prospera's doted-on daughter; Djimon Hounsou is the slave Caliban; and Ben Whishaw is Ariel, the puckish spirit. Alan Cumming, as the treacherous Sebastian, and Chris Cooper, as Antonio, round out the ensemble; Tom Conti is the kindly Gonzalo; David Strathairn is King Alonso; and Russell Brand and Alfred Molina are servants driven by drink and idleness to absurd visions of sovereignty. ''In this noisy, stormy adaptation, an energetic and for the most part excellent cast marshals considerable resources of wit, discipline and timing in a struggle against the hectic inventiveness that is, characteristically for Ms. Taymor, either the vehicle for interesting theatrical ideas or a sign of their absence,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''But rather than cohere into a compellingly new -- or satisfyingly traditional -- rendering of the play, they slosh around, generating glimmers of insight, slivers of feeling and spasms of sensation, as well as empty dazzle and frustration.''
