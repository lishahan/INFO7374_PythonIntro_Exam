(HBO Signature) THE AMERICAN (2010) Before ''The Descendants'' and ''The Ides of March'' brought him Oscar nominations in this latest awards season, George Clooney, above, played a gun-toting expatriate who arrives in a small Italian town after a mishap on his previous job and takes an assignment to build a custom weapon for a sexy assassin (Thekla Reuten). ''I'm out,'' he says at one point, intent on making the kind of human connection that his taciturn temperament and job -- as a hit man, perhaps -- have denied him until now. Soon he has made friends with a priest (Paolo Bonacelli) and a prostitute (Violante Placido), who is so enamored of his prowess in bed that she stops charging him. The film, directed by Anton Corbijn from a script by Rowan Joffe, by ''filtering out any mention of the character's history and suppressing all but the tiniest indications of emotion, tries to strip the man to his essence,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''But there is not quite enough there: the still waters run very cool but not terribly deep, and 'The American' falls back into a view of its protagonist that is ultimately more sentimental than unsettling or intriguing.'' 9 A.M. (Cinemax) WALL STREET: MONEY NEVER SLEEPS (2010) In this sequel to Oliver Stone's 1987 drama, ''Wall Street,'' Michael Douglas, right, returns as the reptilian Gekko, the ruthless corporate raider who, after serving an eight-year prison sentence, has landed in the public spotlight once again for writing a critical and prescient book about the state of the markets. Shia LaBeouf is the investment banker Jake Moore, one of Gekko's fans and the live-in love of Gekko's estranged daughter (Carey Mulligan). Frank Langella is the old-school broker who has been like a father to Jake. And Josh Brolin is the newest snake in town.
