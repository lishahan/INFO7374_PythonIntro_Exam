In 2004, just as Beverly's career as a painter was taking off, her mother died, requiring her to make good on her pledge to Renee, then a 44-year-old who functioned at the level of a third grader. This documentary from Steven Ascher and Jeanne Jordan follows Beverly as she moves Renee, above, from her lifelong home in Greensboro, N.C., to Arizona, where Beverly lived and worked, and then back again to be closer to family. Renee eventually settles into an assisted-living apartment complex to live independently, something unthinkable when her mother was alive. 7:30 A.M.

Viggo Mortensen plays the hippie salesman who turns her life upside down in 1969, as the moon walk and Woodstock loom.
