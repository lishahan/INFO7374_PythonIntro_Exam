(TCM) 8 1/2 (1963) In this dazzling Freudian mosaic from Fellini, Marcello Mastroianni plays an Italian film director who retreats from the demands of moviemaking by reminiscing about his life and loves, and in the process finds inspiration for his next project. Fellini received Oscar nominations for best director and, with his colleagues Ennio Flaiano, Tullio Pinelli and Brunello Rondi, best screenplay. The movie won for best foreign-language film and Piero Gherardi for best costume design. In ''The Bicycle Thief'' (1948), at 7:30, a laborer (Lamberto Maggiorani) and his young son (Enzo Staiola, above right, with Mr. Maggiorani) search for the stolen bicycle that the man desperately needs back to keep his new job. Vittorio De Sica directed this classic neo-realist study of poverty in postwar Rome. 1 P.M. (HBO2) VALENTINE'S DAY (2010) Ashton Kutcher, playing a Los Angeles florist privy to any number of botched romantic situations, leads a cast in this comedy from Garry Marshall, which includes Jessica Alba, Kathy Bates, Jessica Biel , Bradley Cooper, Eric Dane, Patrick Dempsey, Hector Elizondo, Jamie Foxx, Jennifer Garner, Anne Hathaway, Julia Roberts and others. Writing for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis said the best thing about the film ''is that it makes you appreciate and long for the breeziness, acting and basic competency -- the decent lighting, focused cameras and choreographed action -- of 'Love Actually,' the ingratiating British movie it transparently and ineptly rips off.''", "abstract": null, "print_page": "9", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "What's On Today"}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-14T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "The Arts/Cultural Desk", "section_name": "Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Kathryn", "lastname": "SHATTUCK"}], "original": "By KATHRYN SHATTUCK"}, "type_of_material": "Schedule", "_id": "4fd2a7c08eb7c8105d890be5", "word_count": 700, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9505E4DA123CF937A25751C0A9649D8B63", "snippet": "Between the Grammys, Whitney Houston  and Jeremy Lin, the Bagger is nearly overwhelmed by blogworthy topics.
