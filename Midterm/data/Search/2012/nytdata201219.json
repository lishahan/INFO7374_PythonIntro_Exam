The original British mini-series, made in 1979, starred Alec Guinness as Smiley. Mr. Oldman, who can do a fair Guinness-as-Obi-Wan Kenobi impression, didn't rewatch it, for fear of contaminating his performance. (Mr. Oldman is more than decent at impressions; when he jams on Beatles covers with friends, he's always Paul.) Over tea at an Upper East Side hotel, he recently spoke with the Bagger about the turns in his career (he hopes to direct again soon and is working on a script set in the 19th century) and why he was so comfortable playing Smiley on screen. ''He spent a great deal of it sitting down,'' Mr. Oldman said. ''I got quite used to it. I don't know whether I could ever go back to acting standing up.''", "abstract": "Actor Gary Oldman, who has received his first Oscar nomination for the role of George Smiley in Tomas Alfredson movie Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, discusses his fondness for the character, his acting career and future plans.
