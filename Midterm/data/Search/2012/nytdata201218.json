(Ovation) THE FISHER KING (1991) Jeff Bridges portrays Jack Lucas, a radio disc jockey on the verge of suicide after his bullying leads a deranged caller to commit mass murder. He finds redemption in helping Parry (Robin Williams, above), his indirect victim, who has been left homeless and driven half-insane by loss, in this film from Terry Gilliam. ''The best parts of 'The Fisher King' and its mad, whirling vision of modern life are those that see grief lurking just beneath the surface,'' Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times. Mr. Williams received an Oscar nomination for best actor; Mercedes Ruehl won best supporting actress for her role as a video store owner who loves Jack despite it all. 6 A.M. (HBO) SING YOUR SONG (2011) In 1956 Harry Belafonte became the first recording artist to sell more than a million LPs with his album ''Calypso'' and in the process broke color barriers as he rose to success in an era of segregation. He won Grammy, Tony and Emmy Awards but was also blacklisted during the McCarthy era, spied on by the C.I.A. and the F.B.I., and threatened by the Ku Klux Klan, state troopers and Las Vegas Mafia bosses. This documentary from Susanne Rostock distills more than 700 hours of interviews, excerpts from F.B.I. files and archival film to chronicle the life and times of Mr. Belafonte (above center with John F. Kennedy), now 85, from his birth in Harlem and his childhood in Jamaica to his work with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., his struggle against apartheid in South Africa and his actions to counter gang violence and the incarceration of youth.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "9", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "What's On Today"}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-20T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "The Arts/Cultural Desk", "section_name": "Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Kathryn", "lastname": "SHATTUCK"}], "original": "By KATHRYN SHATTUCK"}, "type_of_material": "Schedule", "_id": "4fd2baa08eb7c8105d8b1017", "word_count": 752, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E5D6163EF933A15751C0A9649D8B63", "snippet": "Hollywood keeps trying to turn Reese Witherspoon into a Sandra Bullock or Julia Roberts for a new generation.

But peel him away from the frame, and you find that what used to be the background has quieter and more intriguing virtues. Olatz Schnabel, the Basque-born, Paris-raised former model who for over 17 years was Schnabel's muse and wife, has dedicated a large portion of her life to throwing her husband into even greater relief. Almost as soon as she met him, she gave up her high-end, global, fun-based career (Olatz owned homes in Paris, San Sebastian, Bali and Ibiza) to curate shows for him in Mexico; to influence, inspire and translate. It's fairly safe to say that ''Before Night Falls,'' the movie that won Javier Bardem an Oscar nomination, could not have come about without her.
