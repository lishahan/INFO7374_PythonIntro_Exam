Now Mr. Allen wants to have another go with Helen and ''Bullets'' - and Broadway: He is adapting his original screenplay, written with Douglas McGrath, into a stage musical that producers are aiming to open on Broadway in 2013. The producers, Julian Schlossberg and Letty Aronson, said on Thursday that the show would feature existing music from the period - Prohibition-era 1920s - in addition to the book by Mr. Allen. Like the movie, which was nominated for six other Academy Awards, the musical centers on an aspiring playwright (played by John Cusack in the film) forced to cast a mobster's no-talent girlfriend (Jennifer Tilly) in his show to find financing to produce it.
