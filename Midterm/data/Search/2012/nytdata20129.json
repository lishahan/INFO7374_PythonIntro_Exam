(ABC) THE 84TH ANNUAL ACADEMY AWARDS The tried-and-true Billy Crystal returns for his ninth stint as host of this ceremony broadcast live from the Kodak Theater in Los Angeles (above, setting the scene). George Clooney is up for best actor for ''The Descendants,'' but oddsmakers are predicting that Jean Dujardin will take home the Oscar for his role as a silent-movie star in ''The Artist,'' the black-and-white tribute to a golden age in Hollywood. That film is expected to win best picture as well, while its director, Michel Hazanavicius, is favored for the directing award. Viola Davis is the top best-actress contender for her turn as a courageous maid in ''The Help,'' though Meryl Streep, as Margaret Thatcher in ''The Iron Lady,'' could make it a close race. And in the best-supporting category, Christopher Plummer is expected to win as a father who comes out of the closet near the end of his life in ''Beginners,'' as is Octavia Spencer, who portrayed another determined maid in ''The Help.'' ''A Separation,'' the domestic drama set in Iran, is favored to win for best foreign film. The countdown begins at 1:30 on E!; at 4 on the TV Guide Channel; and at 6 on Channel 11. Tim Gunn, Robin Roberts, Jess Cagle, Nina Garcia and Louise Roe interview celebrities on the red carpet at 7 on ABC. Postshow coverage follows at 11:30 on E! 7 A.M. (Sho2) THE KING'S SPEECH (2010) Colin Firth, below, in the role for which he won the best-actor Oscar last year, portrays Albert Frederick Arthur George, or Bertie, as his family called him, the shy second son of George V of Britain (Michael Gambon) in this film from Tom Hooper. Geoffrey Rush is Lionel Logue, the speech therapist who helps him conquer his debilitating stutter. And Helena Bonham Carter is Elizabeth, Bertie's wife and staunch support system, who can't quite stomach Wallis Simpson (Eve Best), the American divorc\u00e9e who leads Bertie's older brother, David (Guy Pearce), to abdicate as Edward VIII. ''It isn't exactly 'Pygmalion,' not least because Mr. Hooper has no intention of satirizing the caste system that is one of this movie's biggest draws,'' Manohla Dargis, writing in The New York Times, said of the film, which received 12 nominations and earned Mr. Hooper an Oscar as best director. ''Like many entertainments of this pop-historical type, 'The King's Speech' wears history lightly no matter how heavy the crown.'' The film also won Academy Awards for best picture and original screenplay (David Seidler).", "abstract": null, "print_page": "10", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "What's On Sunday"}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-26T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Metropolitan Desk", "section_name": "New York and Region", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Kathryn", "lastname": "SHATTUCK"}], "original": "By KATHRYN SHATTUCK"}, "type_of_material": "Schedule", "_id": "4fd2baa18eb7c8105d8b10fe", "word_count": 744, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/magazine/one-page-magazine.html", "snippet": "Courgartown, Utah; Gehry vs. Ike; and the transgender defender....", "lead_paragraph": "THE BIG PROFILE THELMA SCHOONMAKER", "abstract": "One Page Magazine features a profile of longtime Martin Scorsese editor Thelma Schoonmaker, an analysis of the controversy over the Frank Gehry Eisenhower Memorial, and tips from Stedman Graham on how to be an independent man.
