(13) DON GIOVANNI Mariusz Kwiecien makes his Metropolitan Opera debut as Mozart's promiscuous nobleman in this new production from Michael Grandage, originally broadcast in theaters on Oct. 29 and presented here by ''Great Performances at the Met.'' Marina Rebeka and Mojca Erdmann sing the roles of Donna Anna and Zerlina, two of Giovanni's conquests; Barbara Frittoli (above, with Mr. Kwiecien) is the fiery Donna Elvira, his spurned lover out for revenge; Ram\u00f3n Vargas is Donna Anna's fianc\u00e9, Don Ottavio; and Luca Pisaroni is Giovanni's hapless manservant, Leporello. Mr. Kwiecien, who injured himself at a dress rehearsal and was replaced for opening night and two other performances, ''looked nimble on his feet, sang robustly and threw himself into the title role,'' Anthony Tommasini wrote in The New York Times. ''Whatever one's take on Mr. Kwiecien's portrayal of a role he considers his calling card, his performance was a triumph of physical rehabilitation and artistic determination.'' Mr. Tommasini called the orchestra's performance under Fabio Luisi, the Met's principal conductor, ''a fleet, clear-textured and wonderfully natural account of this multilayered, ingenious score.'' 7 A.M. (Cinemax) BIG FISH (2003) Albert Finney plays Edward Bloom (Ewan McGregor is his youthful version), a traveling salesman from Alabama who has spent a lifetime shading and embellishing the truth in this fantasy from Tim Burton, adapted from the novel by Daniel Wallace. Billy Crudup is Bloom's estranged son, Will, a reporter in Paris who has been summoned home for a deathbed reconciliation, during which Edward elaborates on his biography. Edward's doctor asks: Wouldn't Will prefer to believe that on the day of his birth his father was subduing a legendary catfish rather than selling household gadgets in Wichita? ''The movie insists that the only possible answer is yes, and thus chooses maudlin moonshine over engagement with the difficulties of real life, which is exactly the choice Edward has made,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. ''In their eagerness to celebrate Edward's grand spirit, the filmmakers wind up diminishing it, declining to explore the causes or the costs of his addiction to fantasy.'' Danny Elfman received an Oscar nomination for best original score.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "8", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "What's On Today"}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-23T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "The Arts/Cultural Desk", "section_name": "Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Kathryn", "lastname": "SHATTUCK"}], "original": "By KATHRYN SHATTUCK"}, "type_of_material": "Schedule", "_id": "4fd2ae1e8eb7c8105d89be84", "word_count": 749, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801EEDE133EF930A15751C0A9649D8B63", "snippet": "The last Broadway production of ''Death of a Salesman'' was only 13 years ago, starring Brian Dennehy in a Tony-winning performance as Willy Loman, yet audience interest in Arthur Miller's landmark drama appears higher than ever.

A new ''Salesman'' arrived on Broadway last week, starring Oscar winner Philip Seymour Hoffman (''Capote'') as Willy and the movie star Andrew Garfield (''The Amazing Spider-Man'') as his son Biff, and grossed $613,569 for its first six preview performances - more money per performance than the early previews for either the Dennehy production in 1999 or its predecessor, the Dustin Hoffman-led ''Salesman'' in 1984. In its first week at the box office, this new ''Salesman'' beat every other play on Broadway except for the hit ''War Horse,'' which won the 2011 Tony for best play and grossed $926,111 for its full eight performances last week. The maximum possible gross for the six performances of ''Salesman'' last week was $731,760; the production took in 84 percent of that amount, an extremely high share for a play.", "abstract": "Broadway production of Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman has impressive box office receipts for its first week of preview performances.
