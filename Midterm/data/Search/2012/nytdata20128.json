B. King (above), Keb Mo, Susan Tedeschi and Derek Trucks. Booker T. Jones is the bandleader; Taraji P. Henson hosts. The evening ends with the president serenading the audience with a few bars of ''Sweet Home Chicago.'' ''Blues singing is part oratory, and after a faltering start on Tuesday, Mr. Obama declaimed his lines with adequate warmth and gusto,'' Jon Pareles wrote in The New York Times. ''He also knew enough not to start into an additional verse.'' 6 A.M. (HBO Signature) IT'S KIND OF A FUNNY STORY (2010) Craig (Keir Gilchrist), a teenager plagued by thoughts of suicide, checks himself into a psychiatric hospital after falling for his best friend's girl (Zo\u00eb Kravitz) and finding that his well-meaning parents (Lauren Graham and Jim Gaffigan) can't quite give him the support he needs. Enter Bobby (Zach Galifianakis), a soulful, scatterbrained would-be mentor, and Noelle (Emma Roberts), a potential love interest, who both ease Craig's stay while also complicating it. Writing in The Times, A. O. Scott called this film, adapted from Ned Vizzini's novel by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, ''disarmingly gentle, sweet and whimsical,'' even if some of the brazenness and flair of the book had been lost. But, he added, ''the calm, helpful spirit of the film is also threaded with condescension: this is a movie made by grown-ups, who want to listen and help, to make sure that everyone has a good time, and that nobody gets hurt.''
