Eventually he approaches the property's owner (Nana Patekar, above right, with Mr. Chavan) and becomes his assistant; the rich man, in turn, promises to become Venkatesh's benefactor if he will move from Goa to Mumbai and go to school. ''At first 'The Pool' suggests an inspirational fable in which a selfless older man rescues a youth from the streets,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times about this film by Chris Smith, adapted from a short story by Randy Russell. ''But just when you expect the film to turn into a predictable, rose-colored valentine to opportunity and hope, it goes to a deeper, more ambiguous place. Contemplating poverty from Venkatesh's perspective, it understands that his pursuit of upward mobility will require a terrifying leap of faith.'' The film was chosen as a New York Times Critics' Pick. In ''Summer Hours'' (2009), a movie from Olivier Assayas, at 1:45 p.m., Charles Berling and Juliette Binoche play Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric and Adrienne, siblings who must decide what to do with their mother's charming country house and cherished art collection after her death. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric wants to keep everything the way it is for the enjoyment of the next generation. Adrienne and another brother (J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Renier) want to sell the house and most of its contents, donating the best paintings and furnishings to the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay. ''That, in a nutshell, is the dramatic arc of this extraordinary film, which, in spite of its modest scale, tactful manner and potentially dowdy subject matter, is packed nearly to bursting with rich meaning and deep implication,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. 10:55 A.M. (HBO2) SOMEWHERE (2010) In the first entry in a double bill from Sofia Coppola, Johnny Marco (Stephen Dorff) is a movie star existing in a mind-numbing purgatory -- he drinks, he has anonymous sex, he burns rubber in his Ferrari -- at the Chateau Marmont hotel in Hollywood. He finds something to live for after his ex-wife leaves their 11-year-old daughter (Elle Fanning, right, with Mr. Dorff) in his care. Writing in The Times, A. O. Scott described the movie as ''exquisite, melancholy and formally audacious.'' What happens, he added, ''is something marvelous: a film that never raises its voice (its loudest and most assertive sound is that Ferrari) or panders to your emotions, but that nonetheless has the power to refresh your perceptions and deepen your sympathies.''
