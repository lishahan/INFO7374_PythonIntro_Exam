Other tributes include ''Whitney Houston: Last Days of a Legend,'' at 8 on E!, and ''Whitney Houston, an Icon Remembered,'' at 8 on TV Guide.

(USA) ATONEMENT (2007) Saoirse Ronan plays Briony, a 13-year-old aspiring playwright who accuses Robbie (James McAvoy), the son of a family servant -- and the lover of her older sister, Cecilia (Keira Knightley, above, with Mr. McAvoy) -- of a crime in this drama directed by Joe Wright and adapted by Christopher Hampton from the Ian McEwan novel. Romola Garai and Vanessa Redgrave play Briony as a young woman and as an older writer. ''The main casualty of the film's long, murky middle and end sections is the big moral theme -- and also the ingenious formal gimmick -- that provides the book with some of its intensity and much of its cachet,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''As the title suggests, 'Atonement' is fundamentally about guilt and the attempt to overcome it, and about the tricky, tragically imperfect power of art to compensate for real-life crimes and misdemeanors.''
