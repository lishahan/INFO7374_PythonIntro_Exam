The baseball cap and 1970's leisure ensemble gave way to quasi-Libeskind eyeglasses and spiky hair that screamed ''I am worthy of a cameo on 'Entourage.''' But not worthy of an Oscar. ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' got zero nominations, leaving the Best Picture race to five apolitical movies. Since none of those five has yet sold $100 million worth of tickets, let alone the $350-million-plus of a ''Lord of the Rings''-level megahit, the only real drama accruing to this year's Oscar telecast was whether its ratings would plunge as low as the Golden Globes. But two weeks out from the big night, the prospects for a little conflict are looking up. Just when it seemed that Hollywood had turned a post-election page in the culture wars, the commissars of the right cooked up a new, if highly unlikely, grievance against ''Holly-weird,'' as they so wittily call it. This was no easy task. They couldn't credibly complain that ''The Passion of the Christ'' was snubbed by the movie industry's ''elite'' (translation: Jews), since it nailed three nominations, including one for makeup (translation: really big noses). That showing bested not only ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' but ''Shrek 2,'' the year's top moneymaker.

A leading purveyor of the social-issue movie (police corruption, the injustice of the justice system), the director is, above all, a committed moralist. More than anything, the image that defines a Sidney Lumet film is that of a man -- and, almost inevitably, it is a man -- struggling with his conscience and against the world. The Lumet world is populated by low-down and high-flying thieves, crooked but essentially decent cops, whistle-blowers and ambulance chasers, average, everyday, hurting men.
