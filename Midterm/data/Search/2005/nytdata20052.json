Britney Spears received a worst supporting actress award for her cameo in Michael Moore's documentary, ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' (a film that received no Oscar nominations). That film also garnered awards for President Bush for worst leading actor and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld for worst supporting actor. The Razzies, now in their 25th year, are selected by a membership of about 675 and are presented the night before the Oscars.

Shalit writes that ''Rosen dismisses modern Orthodox men as 'macho sissies' and depicts 'pencil-necked' Orthodox boys.'' I do not dismiss Orthodox men as anything. Deborah, a character in my novel who has had an affair with an Orthodox man about whom she is still conflicted, entertains the ''macho sissies'' thought (along with many other, often contradictory thoughts). Lev, a young man awkwardly entering into a relationship with Deborah, who is a Reform rabbi, has an anxious association with thin yeshiva boys as he himself is about to embark on a session of Talmud study. The boundaries of Judaism are fluid for these characters, as they are in real life. Judaism, to its glory, has so far managed to avoid breaking down into ''denominations,'' but Shalit writes as if no complex web exists linking secular and observant, ancient and modern. In her treatment of other Jewish writers, Shalit gathers up a few biographical scraps to determine whether these writers are ''outsiders'' or ''insiders'' -- as if the authority of a literary work were a matter of birthright and not imaginative power. This is a sad diversion from all the truly interesting questions there are to be raised about religion and the imagination, about traditional Judaism and works of new creation, about honest exploration and communal anxiety. One wonders what Shalit would make of the story about the cunning ancestor who robs his brother and cheats his father -- but then the Bible doesn't specify whether Jacob is Reform, Conservative, Orthodox or haredi. Shalit's attack on the way contemporary Jewish novelists do -- or do not -- write about the haredi community put me in mind of Oscar Wilde's observation that the 19th-century dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban seeing his own face in a glass. Wilde added that the 19th-century dislike of romanticism is the rage of Caliban not seeing his own face in a glass. Shalit's dislike seems to be for imaginative fiction itself -- her prerogative, of course, but a strange attribute for someone writing seriously about it.

Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street. Tele-charge. DOUBT -- John Patrick Shanley's acclaimed drama received reviews that playwrights drool for during its Off Broadway run this season at the Manhattan Theater Club. Now it comes to Broadway with its excellent cast intact, including Cherry Jones and Brian F. O'Byrne. The drama, which explores the hot-button issue of child abuse in the Roman Catholic Church, should be a formidable contender come Tony time. Previews begin March 9. Opens March 31. Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street. Tele-charge. GORILLA MAN -- Kyle Jarrow, whose bizarre and fertile imagination has given birth to plays about Scientologists and a man who lopped off his arms, has created a rock musical about an increasingly hairy boy who goes ape -- literally.

Wolfe directs. Previews begin March 10. Opens March 27. Public Theater. Tele-charge. www.publictheater.org WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? -- The early prognosticators, who it should be said are often wrong, are guessing that this will not be a fair fight. In one corner is the force of nature Kathleen Turner, who applies her breathy voice and considerable charms to the character of Martha, one half of the most combustible couple in modern drama. In the other corner is the talented, if mild-mannered, new vaudevillian Bill Irwin, whose George should be a decided underdog. This being the revival of Edward Albee's classic tale of marital dysfunction, let's hope there are plenty of punches below the belt. Anthony Page directs. Previews begin March 12. Opens March 20. Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street. Tele-charge. PLAY WITHOUT WORDS -- The startlingly reimagined 1998 production of ''Swan Lake'' was the first time the work of the British choreographer-director Matthew Bourne appeared on Broadway. And he plans to have a blockbuster follow-up when the Disney musical ''Mary Poppins,'' which he choreographed, transfers from the West End. If you can't wait, Mr. Bourne brings in another equally praised, if less commercial (that title is no joke), production this season. Based on Joseph Losey's 1963 film ''The Servant,'' with its screenplay by Harold Pinter, the dance-theater piece, devised and directed by Mr. Bourne and set to a jazz score, explores the tensions between the moneyed owner of a Chelsea town house and his domestic staff.

Tele-charge. www.lincolncenter.org THE PILLOWMAN -- After a raved-about run in London, the latest darkly comic thriller from Martin McDonagh (''The Beauty Queen of Leenane'') has already generated an equal amount of buzz and fear.
