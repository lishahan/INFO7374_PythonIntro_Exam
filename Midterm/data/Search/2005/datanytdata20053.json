(If you're rich, you're ''eccentric''; if you're poor, you're nuts.) One scene in that film is fixed in my memory because it may feature an anachronism. The classic example of such a time warp of phraseology is in Shakespeare's ''Julius Caesar,'' set in ancient times, in which Cassius says, ''The clock hath stricken three.'' The Bard forgot that clocks that strike the hour had probably not been invented at the time. In ''The Aviator,'' a glittering party is held to celebrate the conclusion of the filming of Hughes's 1930 epic, ''Hell's Angels.'' What struck me was a large sign with red lettering: ''Hell's Angels 'It's a Wrap.' '' The placement of the phrase within quotation marks suggests it was fresh at the time. But was it? Or did the director or screenwriter project a current phrase back in time?", "abstract": "On Language column by William Safire explores meaning and derivation of phrases 'that's a wrap' and 'the game is not worth the candle' (M)", "print_page": "36", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "'It's A Wrap'", "kicker": "THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 2-27-05: ON LANGUAGE"}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "LANGUAGE AND LANGUAGES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ENGLISH LANGUAGE"}], "pub_date": "2005-02-27T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Magazine Desk", "section_name": "Movies; Magazine", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "William", "lastname": "Safire"}], "original": "By William Safire"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd244418eb7c8105d7de9d0", "word_count": 1123, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/27/arts/27RICH.html", "snippet": "The marketing of the Oscars proves that it is still the American way to lament indecency even while gobbling it up....", "lead_paragraph": "THE total box office for all five best-picture nominees on tonight's Oscars is so small that their collective niche in the national cultural marketplace falls somewhere between square dancing and non-Grisham fiction. But if this year's Oscars are worthless as a barometer of the broad state of American pop culture, there's much to learn from the hype spun by ABC and the motion picture academy to seduce Americans to watch even if they can't distinguish Clive Owen from Catalina Sandino Moreno. The selling of the Oscar show is the latest indicator of the most telling disconnect in our politics: in the post-Janet Jackson era, ''indecency'' is gaining in popularity in direct proportion to Washington's campaign to shut indecency down. Hollywood can read the numbers. Once the feds vowed to smite future ''wardrobe malfunctions,'' the customers started bolting the annual TV franchises where those malfunctions and their verbal counterparts are apt to occur. An award show sanitized of vulgarity and encased in the prophylactic of tape delay is an oxymoron. And so the Golden Globes lost 40 percent of its audience in January on NBC, the Grammys lost 28 percent of its audience this month on CBS. The viewers turned up instead at the competing ''Desperate Housewives'' on ABC, where S-and-M is the latest item on the carnal menu. Though this year's Super Bowl didn't have to go up against that runaway hit, its born-again family-friendliness also took a ratings toll; the audience in the all-important 18-to-49 demographic fell to an all-time low. The viewers perked up only for a GoDaddy.com commercial parodying a Washington ''Broadcast Censorship Hearing'': TiVo reported that the spot's utterly unrevealing ''wardrobe malfunction'' gag was the most replayed moment from any of the game's ads, much as the Jackson-Timberlake pas de deux that inspired it was the TiVo sensation of the year before.", "abstract": "Frank Rich column on ABC and motion picture academy's effort to lure TV viewers back to annual Oscars show by implying that comedian Chris Rock, who is this year's host, will bring 'indecency' to the program;
