The three of them -- on drums, guitar and tenor saxophone -- are working over a tune on three independent grids of rubato rhythm. When it's a real song-song, by Thelonious Monk or Bud Powell or Jerome Kern, as opposed to something more vague, Mr. Lovano tends to play the prow, establishing the melody with a broad, buzzy tone. Mr. Frisell, fitting three or five passing chords into a juncture where one might do, then adding a perfect and miniaturized Chet Atkins lick, lags behind Mr. Lovano a little. Mr. Motian remains out there darkly in the background, watchfully sketching around, never directly stating a pulse, tracing wide, loose melodic shapes with a small drum kit.", "abstract": "Ben Ratliff reviews new CD by Paul Motian Trio; photo (M)", "print_page": "3", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Critic's Choice: New CD's", "kicker": "Critic's Choice"}, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "LOVANO, JOE"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "FRISELL, BILL"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "MOTIAN, PAUL"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "MOTIAN, PAUL, TRIO"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECORDINGS (AUDIO)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MUSIC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "JAZZ"}], "pub_date": "2005-02-07T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "The Arts/Cultural Desk", "section_name": "Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Ben", "lastname": "Ratliff"}], "original": "By Ben Ratliff"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd245f88eb7c8105d7e06a1", "word_count": 639, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/07/fashion/07dres.html", "snippet": "A few trends are starting to appear in the opening days of Fashion Week: a linear silhouette, a surfeit of men's wear fabrics and a certain sexiness....", "lead_paragraph": "Saturday evening on my way to a fashion show in Chelsea I passed a small clump of photographers waiting on the sidewalk for a V.I.P. to exit her white stretch limousine.
