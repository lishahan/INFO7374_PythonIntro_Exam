And \"Masterpiece Theater\" on public television has been a chief beneficiary. Earlier this season, there was \"The Best of Friends,\" with John Gielgud and Patrick McGoohan. This Sunday at 9 P.M. on Channel 13 there is \"The Countess Alice,\" co-starring Zoe Wanamaker. Miss Hiller has always been a gifted actress. That much was spotted early on by none other than George Bernard Shaw, who handpicked her for two major film performances: Eliza Doolittle in \"Pygmalion\" and the title role in \"Major Barbara.\" Among other career landmarks, she won an Oscar as best supporting actress in the 1958 film version of Terence Rattigan's \"Separate Tables.\" Miss Hiller has rarely failed to impress, but her recent performances have assumed an even higher level of authority.
