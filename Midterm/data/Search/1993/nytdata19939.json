The first is slow and quiet, the second fast and loud; but together they form a dense, thought-provoking unit. Downstairs at the Studio Museum in Harlem, restraint rules. Proceeding at an almost stately pace, the show focuses on the unfolding of Wifredo Lam's moody but gentlemanly art in the years just before, during and after World War II. Lam, who was born in Cuba of a Chinese father and a mulatto mother, went to Spain to study art in 1923, when he was 21, and to Paris in 1938, where he was befriended by Picasso and Andre Breton. He spent most of the years covered by this exhibition back in Cuba, driven there by the war in 1941, and during this time he integrated Cubist and Surrealist innovations with symbols and motifs of his own Afro-Cuban culture.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "3", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Review/Art; Restraint and Ebullience In Cuban and Colleagues"}, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "LAM, WILFREDO"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ART SHOWS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ART"}], "pub_date": "1993-01-08T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Weekend Desk", "section_name": "Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Roberta", "rank": 1, "lastname": "SMITH"}], "original": "BY ROBERTA SMITH"}, "type_of_material": "Review", "_id": "4fd1e3fc8eb7c8105d72e4c9", "word_count": 1054, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/08/movies/critic-s-notebook-at-wits-end-algonquinites-in-hollywood.html", "snippet": "BY 1935, Dorothy Parker had abandoned the life of a New York sophisticate for that of a Hollywood screenwriter, but the sunshine did nothing to mellow her caustic outlook.
