He was 79. He had been hospitalized two-and-a-half weeks ago for congestive heart failure, said Ron Wise, a hospital spokesman. A lyricist whose most important collaborators were the composers Jule Styne, Jimmy Van Heusen and Saul Chaplin, Mr. Cahn wrote the words for dozens of songs that became hits, including \"All the Way,\" \"Day By Day,\" \"Time After Time,\" and \"Three Coins in the Fountain.\" The typical Cahn lyric was brashly assertive and often unabashedly sentimental. \"When somebody loves you, it's no good unless she loves you all the way,\" went his opening line for \"All the Way,\" from the 1957 film \"The Joker Is Wild.\" The song became a No. 1 hit for Frank Sinatra and won the year's Oscar.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Sammy Cahn, Word Weaver Of Tin Pan Alley, Dies at 79"}, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "CAHN, SAMMY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MUSIC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DEATHS"}], "pub_date": "1993-01-16T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Cultural Desk", "section_name": "Arts; Obituaries", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Stephen", "rank": 1, "lastname": "HOLDEN"}], "original": "By STEPHEN HOLDEN"}, "type_of_material": "Biography; Obituary", "_id": "4fd1e5af8eb7c8105d73117b", "word_count": 1203, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/15/nyregion/principal-s-legacy-hope-mixed-with-despair-red-hook-struggles-prove-that.html", "snippet": "The shooting at the Red Hook Houses started a few minutes after midnight Friday.
