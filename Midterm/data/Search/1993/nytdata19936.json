Against a background of flashing videos, silver statuettes will be handed out to designers and others who have made fashion news. Among them are Donna Karan for her untraditional men's wear, Marc Jacobs for his foray into grunge, Chrome Hearts for its silver and black leather biker accessories and Steven Meisel for his arresting fashion photography. Want more excitement? The lineup of presenters includes Cher (in something outrageous, no doubt), Natasha Richardson and Elton John.
