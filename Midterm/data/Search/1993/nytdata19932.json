Yet, when the collective efforts of a handful of gifted creators result in a season like this one, it's clear that haute couture has its reasons. Whatever the specific intent -- artistic expression, customer satisfaction, product endorsement -- the spring couture delivered. Each designer had his distinct way of stating the case, but the overall impression was one of drenchingly feminine fashion and softer, less structured style. Everyone expects Karl Lagerfeld to blaze a trail with the collection he designs for Chanel. And he did. Having first set forth the long, willowy line a year ago, Lagerfeld now suggests it be softened with wisps of ankle-length chiffon dresses that are marvels of cuts and techniques not seen since the 1930's. What makes these dresses of the moment are the beautifully made, seemingly knockabout tweed jackets that go with them. (As usual, this Chanel collection was laced with superb jackets in enough variations to suit everyone, from the most sedate customer to the fastest of faddists.) And then, there were all those Lagerfeld for Chanel details that will surely spawn imitation, like the fluttery trailing collars and cuffs and the needle-toed booties.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "52", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Paris Couture", "kicker": "FASHION"}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "APPAREL"}], "pub_date": "1993-02-21T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Magazine Desk", "section_name": "Magazine", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Carrie", "rank": 1, "lastname": "Donovan"}], "original": "By Carrie Donovan"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd1c81d8eb7c8105d6fa611", "word_count": 561, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/21/nyregion/voice-of-assistance-and-more-aided-by-neediest-cases-fund.html", "snippet": "In a crowded room in midtown Manhattan, 28-year-old Chin Kuoyen was confronting his nemesis.
