Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Broadway 'THE APPLE TREE' The amazing Kristin Chenoweth gives Imax-screen-size life to three curvaceous doodles who by rights shouldn't be any larger than figures in the Sunday funnies. Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick's 1966 musical, directed by Gary Griffin, shows its age but is given theatrical verve by Ms. Chenoweth, Brian d'Arcy James and Marc Kudisch (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Ben Brantley) 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA' Lincoln Center Theater's brave, gorgeous, sprawling and ultimately exhilarating production of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about intellectuals errant in 19th-century Russia. A testament to the seductive powers of narrative theater, directed with hot and cool canniness by Jack O'Brien and featuring a starry cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Martha Plimpton, Josh Hamilton and Ethan Hawke, among others) in a tasty assortment of roles. Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raul Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MIS\u00c9RABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) * 'TRANSLATIONS' The estimable Irish director Garry Hynes (a Tony winner for Martin McDonagh's ''Beauty Queen of Leenane'') has assembled an ensemble of an extraordinarily high caliber and consistency for the third major New York production of Brian Friel's 1980 play. Set in rural Ireland in 1833, as the local tongue is being supplanted by the language of the English occupying forces, the play explores the seriocomic truth that language can divide as easily as it unites, and can never hope to translate the rich music in our souls with the delicacy we yearn for. A top-flight Broadway revival (2:15). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE VERTICAL HOUR' David Hare's soggy consideration of the Anglo-American cultural divide stars Julianne Moore (representing the Americans) and Bill Nighy (leading the British), directed by Sam Mendes. The Yanks don't stand a chance (2:20). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ALL THAT I WILL EVER BE' In this false-feeling comedy-drama by Alan Ball, creator of ''Six Feet Under,'' a gay hustler undergoes an identity crisis when he finds himself falling for one of his clients. Slick but mostly stale in its analysis of a society afraid of emotional engagement (2:15). The New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE BIG VOICE: GOD OR MERMAN?' Think of two gifted and smart gay men with years of life together deploying their considerable talents from the two pianos you happen to have in your living room. The result is a hilarious and very touching memoir of two decades of love and the funky glories of show business life (2:00). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE FEVER' Wallace Shawn performs his provocative monologue about a guilt-riddled bourgeois everyman sweating his way through a moral crisis. The rich, often hypnotic writing draws us into his tortured mindscape, as he shifts between shame over his sense of entitlement and reasoned arguments that sacrifice is unnecessary and pointless. Meanwhile, in the third world, the violence and poverty continue unabated (1:30). Acorn Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time. The excellent duo Jeremy Shamos and Christopher Fitzgerald make the pitch (2:05). The Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman) * 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of vibrant, funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Anita Gates) 'THE LAST WORD ' Oren Safdie's comedy about cultural generation gaps amuses as it goes along but lands at a predictable nowhere. Daniel J. Travanti stars as a Viennese Jew and aspiring playwright who does battle with a young student angling to become his writing assistant and find his voice (1:30). Theater at St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Ginia Bellafante) 'THE MADRAS HOUSE' A century-old drama about ''the woman question,'' this rare revival of Harley Granville Barker's fascinating play is more contemporary than you might think (2:30). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. (Zinoman) 'MARAT/SADE' The first New York production of Peter Weiss's classic 1963 play captures the rawness and shock of the original with a harrowing production. The inmates of this all-male asylum fling themselves against the chain-links of their enclosure; realistic-looking vomit and feces feature in one key scene; the audience is sprayed with water from the attendants' hoses and reminded that theater is not always a safe place. It's undeniably powerful; unfortunately, it remains a blunt instrument rather than a polished one, since the language is not mined as deeply as the emotion. Marat and Sade's philosophical debate, and the play's topicality, tend to be obscured by the sheer brute force of what's happening onstage (2:10). The Classical Theater of Harlem, Harlem School of the Arts Theater, 647 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, (212) 868-4444. (Anne Midgette) 'MARY ROSE' J. M. Barrie penned this distaff variation on themes from ''Peter Pan'' in 1920, and it has mostly lain on the shelf since. A young English girl (an exuberant Paige Howard) acquires the odd habit of disappearing and reappearing some time later, untouched by time's passing. Gentle and melancholy, handsomely mounted by Tina Landau, ''Mary Rose'' is nonetheless itself touched by the mark of time (1:45). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303. (Isherwood) 'THE MERCHANT OF VENICE' and 'THE JEW OF MALTA' F. Murray Abraham plays two Elizabethan villains in repertory for the Theater for a New Audience. Mr. Abraham's sinister but still moving Shylock is the dark heart of Darko Tresnjak's chilly, powerful staging of one of Shakespeare's unfunniest comedies. As Barabas in David Herskovits's goofy, postmodern ''Jew of Malta,'' he's the lively center of a carnival that doesn't do justice to Christopher Marlowe's harsh satire on Christian hypocrisy and venality (each 2:30). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00).SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Neil Genzlinger) '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban) 'A VERY COMMON PROCEDURE' Courtney Baron's play suffers from a very common problem: For at least half of this one-act's running time, the characters onstage are talking to us, not one another. Paradoxically, this intimacy between audience and actors keeps the story -- an odd love affair between a woman grieving the death of her baby and the doctor involved in the baby's death -- at arm's length (1:20). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) * 'THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE' David Mamet has cleanly and cannily adapted Harley Granville Barker's 1905 play about corruption in the genteel world of Victorian finance. An excellent cast and a sumptuous production bring extra immediacy to a tale of embezzlement and entitlement that feels as fresh as tomorrow's stock options (1:50). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'WAKE UP MR. SLEEPY! YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS DEAD!' Richard Foreman's latest film-theater hybrid is a memorial service, of sorts, for the intuitive self, killed by a surface-worshiping world. It is also a dazzling exercise in reality shifting that is as invigorating as it is mournful (1:05). Ontological Theater at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway 'AT LEAST IT'S PINK' Bridget Everett and her big, bad attitude co-star in this mini-musical about sex and unsatisfying jobs in the city. Directed by Michael Patrick King (of ''Sex and the City,'' as it happens), who is also the co-author, and with songs written by Ms. Everett and Kenny Mellman, the piano-playing half of Kiki & Herb. Raucous and rude, it's a bit like a one-woman episode of ''Jerry Springer'' (1:20). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood) 'JACKIE WITH A Z' Delectably outrageous (1:30). Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'ORESTEIA' David Johnston's take on Aeschylus includes some of this irreverent playwright's trademark off-kilter sensibility but not his familiar flights of fancy (1:30). Access Theater, 380 Broadway, north of White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) 'T J AND DAVE' The comics T. J. Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance. This is an impressive feat of mental athletics, but the results are also observant, complex and frequently enormously funny (1:00).Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.

(Brantley) Last Chance 'ADRIFT IN MACAO' Christopher Durang wrote the book (cute) and lyrics (crude) for this fortune-cookie-size musical set in a Chinese port in the 1950s. Flimsy but fun, this spoof of old movies is lovingly acted by a swell cast, although an hour after it's over, you may be hungry for reruns of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'ART*******' Michael Domitrovich shows a good ear for dialogue in this play about five 20-somethings wallowing in the New York art scene and in their own vacuousness, but it's not quite enough to make them anything other than irritating (2:00). Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 254-1109; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'THE JADED ASSASSIN' Imagine mediocre professional wrestling mixed with ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,'' and you get the idea (1:15). The Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman) 'NELSON' Three arresting performances catch your attention in this creepy play by Sam Marks about a young man who is an office flunky by day but films gang videos at night. But having set a lot of intriguing things in motion, Mr. Marks is afraid to let them collide head-on (1:10). The Lion Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes tomorrow. (Genzlinger) 'A SPANISH PLAY' The great Zoe Caldwell returns to the New York stage after an absence of a decade, in the fine company of Linda Emond, Denis O'Hare and Larry Pine. That's the good news. The bad? The play. Yasmina Reza's pseudo-philosophical and metatheatrical trifle is utterly forgettable (1:50). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'THE ABANDONED' (R, 95 minutes) The title of this dull, hysterical horror movie seems to refer to its release strategy. The greatest mystery is why it showed up in theaters at all, rather than going straight to DVD. (A. O. Scott) 'AMAZING GRACE' (PG, 120 minutes) Michael Apted's prettified take on the life and times of the 18th-century reformer William Wilberforce carries a strong whiff of piety but is generally pleasing and often moving, and features fine performances from newcomers and veterans alike. (Manohla Dargis) 'THE ASTRONAUT FARMER' (PG, 102 minutes) This sentimental fable about a Texas rancher who follows his dreams and builds a rocket ship in his barn is made bearable -- just -- by Billy Bob Thornton's underplayed performance in the lead role, and also by the wide-eyed visual wonderment of the director, Michael Polish, who is the co-writer of the picture with his twin brother, Mark. (Scott) 'BABEL' (R, 143 minutes, in English, Spanish, Japanese, Berber, Arabic and sign language) This hugely ambitious movie tells four loosely linked stories set on three continents. The themes, to the extent they are decipherable, include loss, fate and the terrible consequences of miscommunication. Written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, the movie is an intellectual muddle but a visceral tour de force, and the power of the filmmaking almost overcomes the fuzziness of the ideas. Almost. (Scott) * 'BAMAKO' (No rating, 118 minutes, in French and Bambara) Abdelrahmane Sissako's new film is an indictment of the West's complicity in Africa's misery, staged as a public trial of the World Bank and its affiliates. The film's passionate didacticism is both enriched and subverted by Mr. Sissako's deft, subtle attention to the details of daily life in the capital of Mali, where the movie takes place. (Scott) 'BLOOD DIAMOND' (R, 138 minutes) The makers of this foolish thriller about illegal diamond trafficking in Africa, starring an excellent Leonardo DiCaprio, want you to know there may be blood on your hands, specifically your wedding finger. Too bad they haven't thought through what it means to turn misery into entertainment. (Dargis) 'BREACH' (PG-13, 110 minutes) In his fine, no-nonsense account of the capture of the F.B.I. agent turned mole Robert Philip Hanssen, the director Billy Ray manages to excite and unnerve despite our knowing the ending. Chris Cooper and Ryan Phillippe star. (Dargis) * 'BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA' (PG, 95 minutes) Grounded more in reality than in fantasy, this adaptation of Katherine Paterson's novel offers an affecting story of a transformative friendship between two gifted children. Beautifully capturing a time when a bully in school can loom as large as a troll in a nightmare, the director, Gabor Csupo, keeps the fantasy in the background to find magic in the everyday. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Winner of the Oscar for best picture, Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis) 'DREAMGIRLS' (PG-13, 131 minutes) The Broadway musical arrives on the screen, capably directed by Bill Condon, ardently acted and sung by Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy, Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles and (especially) Jennifer Hudson, who won a best-supporting-actress Oscar for her performance, but undone by mediocre and anachronistic songs. (Scott) 'GHOST RIDER' (PG-13, 114 minutes) After a long string of financial flops, Nicolas Cage returns to play Johnny Blaze, a stunt motorcycle rider whose soul belongs to the Devil. Despite the promise of the first 30 minutes -- when Johnny is played by the charming young actor Matt Long -- a witless script and a central character who's more funny than frightening suggest that the filmmakers' franchise hopes may be dashed. (Catsoulis) 'HANNIBAL RISING' (R, 121 minutes) This primer on Hannibal Lecter reduces a mythic villain to a callow, dysfunctional chef. Orphaned in World War II, our psychopathic hero hunts down his family's killers and snacks on their remains. But burrowing into the id of pop culture's most repulsive gourmet demands a sanguinary glee that the director, Peter Webber, may not possess; for all the movie's spurting gore, there's no rush of blood to the head. (Catsoulis) 'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker, in an Oscar-winning performance, plays the mad king, while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis) * 'LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA' (R, 141 minutes, in Japanese) Another masterwork from Clint Eastwood's astonishing late period, and one of the best war movies ever. Ken Watanabe is especially fine as the general commanding Japanese troops in the doomed defense of the island of Iwo Jima. (Scott) * 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott) * 'Little Miss Sunshine' (R, 101 minutes) A bittersweet comedy of dysfunction that takes place at the terminus of the American dream. The excellent cast includes Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano and that national treasure, Alan Arkin, who won an Oscar for best supporting actor. (Dargis) * 'THE LIVES OF OTHERS' (R, 137 minutes, in German) Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's debut feature, winner of the Academy Award for best foreign-language film, takes place in East Berlin in 1984, and it is a smart, moving inquiry into the moral predicament facing good people in a bad system. Ulrich M\u00fche's performance as a conscience-stricken Stasi officer is a tightly wound tour de force, and Sebastian Koch and Martina Gedeck are both superb as a playwright and his actress lover who are drawn into the cruel, absurd clutches of the Communist secret police. (Scott) 'MUSIC AND LYRICS' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Drew Barrymore and Hugh Grant phone in passable impersonations of themselves in this competent romantic comedy, which is somewhat enlivened by parodies of bad pop songs from both the 1980s and the present. (Scott) 'NOTES ON A SCANDAL' (R, 92 minutes) Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett play a misogynistic game of cat and mouse from which no one emerges unscathed, including the audience. Adapted by Patrick Marber from a novel by Zo\u00eb Heller and directed by Richard Eyre. (Dargis) 'THE NUMBER 23' (R, 95 minutes) An accidental comedy starring a deadly serious Jim Carrey that owes something to David Fincher, a little something else to Robert Anton Wilson and next to nothing, at least intentionally, to the gods of laughter, be they Gelus (Greek) or Jerry Lewis (American). (Dargis) * 'PAN'S LABYRINTH' (R, 119 minutes, in Spanish) Guillermo del Toro's tale of a young girl's ordeal in post-Civil-War fascist Spain is either a fairy tale in the guise of a political allegory or vice versa. In either case it is a moving, enchanting, strange and humane example of popular art at its very best. (Scott) 'THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) How you respond to this fairy tale in realist drag may depend on whether you find Will Smith's performances so overwhelmingly winning that you buy the idea that poverty is a function of bad luck and bad choices, and success the result of heroic toil and dreams. (Dargis) * 'THE QUEEN' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Directed by Stephen Frears from a very smart script by Peter Morgan, and starring a magnificent Helen Mirren (who won an Oscar) in the title role, ''The Queen'' pries open a window in the House of Windsor around the time of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, blending fact with fiction. (Dargis) 'RENO 911!: MIAMI' (R, 81 minutes) The title more or less says all you need to know about the story, the action and the point. (Dargis) 'STARTER FOR TEN' (PG-13, 96 minutes) This amiable, nostalgic British comedy tackles a lofty subject -- the allure of knowledge --with down-to-earth charm, following a working-class kid (James McAvoy) during his first year at Bristol University and an appearance on the TV quiz show ''University Challenge.'' But beneath the formulaic embarrassments and fumbled learning curve lurks a more somber theme: the inevitable rupture between those who pursue an education and those left behind. (Catsoulis) 'VENUS' (R, 91 minutes) A modest, diverting, touching tale of a young woman who attracts the interest -- avuncular and also erotic -- of an aging actor, played with effortless aplomb by the great Peter O'Toole. (Scott) * 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Almod\u00f3var, with Pen\u00e9lope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott) 'THE WAYWARD CLOUD' (No rating, 112 minutes, in Mandarin) The latest from the Taiwanese filmmaker Tsai Ming-Liang is a musical, with very little dialogue and a good deal of explicit sex. Unfortunately, Mr. Tsai's energetic provocation, a notable contrast to his usual rigorous, dryly kinky style, seems more like a sign of artistic frustration than like an audacious new direction. (Scott) Film Series FRENCH SEVENTIES: CINEMA AFTER MAY '68 (Tuesday) The protests of May 1968 left an indelible mark on French society and French cinema, a link that will be explored in a series of screenings organized by Jean-Michel Frodon, the editor in chief of Les Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma. The program begins on Tuesday with ''Le Diable Probablement,'' Robert Bresson's dark 1977 look at the lives of Parisian students fatally disenchanted with the adult world. The 7 p.m. screening, which has a special admission price of $12, will be followed by a question-and-answer session with Mr. Frodon and the director Beno\u00eet Jacquot (whose ''Assassin Musicien'' will be shown on March 13). French Institute/Alliance Fran\u00e7aise, Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 355-6100, fiaf.org; $9. (Dave Kehr) ABBAS KIAROSTAMI: 'IMAGE MAKER' (Today through Thursday) The Museum of Modern Art asserts that this 33-film retrospective of the work of the Iranian filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami is the most complete examination of his career yet mounted in the United States. Mr. Kiarostami's minimalist aesthetics and deeply felt humanism make for a rare and profound combination, as demonstrated in masterworks like ''Close-Up'' (1990) (screening on Monday) and ''Through the Olive Trees'' (1994) (Wednesday). This weekend's programs concentrate on the first part of Mr. Kiarostami's career, when he was making short educational films for children under the auspices of the Institute for the Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults in Iran, and includes his first feature-length film, the 1974 ''The Traveler'' (tonight). Meanwhile, Mr. Kiarostami's 2006 video installation ''Five'' will play continuously in MoMA's Yoshiko and Akio Morita Gallery, and an exhibition of his photographs will continue at MoMA's Queens ally, P.S. 1. Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Kehr) 'OUT 1' (Tomorrow and Sunday) When the Museum of the Moving Image presented all 12 and a half hours of Jacques Rivette's famously hard-to-see French film, ''Out 1,'' last fall, it proved to be one of the movie events of the year, and even won the museum a special citation from the National Society of Film Critics. This weekend, the museum is offering an encore presentation of this fascinating, unwieldy film, which revolves around the on- and offstage lives of avant-garde actors in Paris. The first four episodes will be shown tomorrow, starting at 2 p.m., with a dinner break at 5:30 (box dinner available by advance order); the final four at 2 p.m. on Sunday. Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us; $32 for both days. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. BATTLEFIELD BAND (Monday) Old-fashioned bagpipes and whistles and up-to-date synthesizers drive the Battlefield Band, which has been having its way with traditional and traditionalist songs since it was founded three decades ago in Scotland. At 7:30 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Jon Pareles) THE BIRD AND THE BEE (Tonight) The Bird and the Bee, a well-dressed duo from Los Angeles, toys with two fashionable ideas: retro French pop glittering with electronics, and ''Sex and the City''-style sexual conundrums. The singer Inara George mulls the ways of noncommittal boyfriends and promises in a catwalk soprano -- to herself or a man, it's never clear -- ''I would be so winning, so absolutely winning.'' With Foreign Islands. At 9:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10. (Ben Sisario) * SOLOMON BURKE (Sunday) Solomon Burke is a larger-than-life, gospel-rooted 1960s soul man whose vocal jabs taught Mick Jagger, among others, a few things about singing. He is still a vocal powerhouse, full of dramatic whims, who earns the right to perform from a throne. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $35 in advance, $37 at the door. (Pareles) MARC COHN (Thursday) His 1991 hit ''Walking in Memphis'' sums up Marc Cohn's style: smoothly rolling chords; a supple, soul-inflected voice; and a kindly outlook. He has been known to sing not only his songs but also his stage patter. At 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7000, carnegiehall.org; sold out. (Pareles) * JUDY COLLINS (Tonight) What Ms. Collins brings to a song , whether she wrote it or not, is perspective. You have the sense of a woman standing alone in the night air, gazing at a star and directing a beam of psychic energy into the cosmos. Or maybe she is the receiver of this cool, steady light; it cuts both ways. At 8:45, Caf\u00e9 Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $100 cover at tables, $65 at the bar. (Stephen Holden) ROB DICKINSON (Tonight) In the '90s Mr. Dickinson led the Catherine Wheel, a British band that created a muscular, dramatic sweep with fogs of guitar noise. He has since refashioned himself as a cynical balladeer in the Warren Zevon mode, the kind who may or may not be sarcastic when saying that the secret to life is merely ''to smile and hang out with intelligent people.'' At 7:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $15. (Sisario) GOMEZ, BEN KWELLER (Thursday) Gomez emerged in the heyday of '90s Britpop with an against-the-grain obsession with tight, sharp blues-rock. On its latest album, ''How We Operate'' (ATO), the band has veered into folkier realms, but still plays with unusual precision and focus. Ben Kweller survived his time as a teenage rock prodigy and has carved out a niche as an ambitious singer-songwriter, playing all the instruments on his latest, self-titled album. At 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $28 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sisario) NANCI GRIFFITH (Tuesday and Wednesday) A Texas songwriter with an affinity for acoustic guitars, little-girl vocals and life's small but resonant epiphanies, Ms. Griffith stepped way out of character on her newest album, ''Ruby's Torch'' (Rounder), immersing herself in the dramatic sweep of ''In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning'' and torch songs by Jimmy Webb and Tom Waits. For her Blue Note debut, the club promises that she will be going the distance with the new role, appearing in a red velvet dress and singing into ''an old-school hanging mic.'' At 8 and 10:30 p.m., 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; $35 cover at tables, $20 at the bar; $5 minimum. (Sisario) * GRIZZLY BEAR (Tuesday and Wednesday) The acoustic guitars, strings, brushed percussion and library voices say cozy folk, but the enormous ambition of this Brooklyn band pushes its dreamlike, bewitching songs past psychedelia and prog and into uncharted realms. With Beach House and the Papercuts. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) IZZYS (Tomorrow) With a repertory of lean, uncomplicated blues-boogies, this New York band worships at the twin retro-rock altars of the Rolling Stones and the Stooges (with a little Gram Parsons country thrown in as well). At 11 p.m., Lakeside Lounge, 162 Avenue B, between 10th and 11th Streets, East Village, (212) 529-8463, lakesidelounge.com; free. (Sisario) ESSIE JAIN (Tuesday) A British singer and songwriter who lives in New York, Ms. Jain builds stark miniatures out of a few light strums of guitar and her haunting alto. On her captivating new album, ''We Made This Ourselves'' (Ba Da Bing), her voice is multitracked in precise harmonies that can be warm or ghostly. With Pepi Ginsberg and the Lost Americans. At 8 p.m., Tap Bar at the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $7. (Sisario) * CHARLIE LOUVIN, LAURA CANTRELL (Thursday) Four years ago the Nashville establishment offered its obeisance to the Louvin Brothers, the close-harmony country-gospel duo from Arkansas whose influence was greater than their record sales: a tribute album, ''Livin', Lovin', Losin','' with Vince Gill, Dolly Parton, Emmylou Harris, Johnny Cash and others, which won a Grammy. Now it's the alterna-crowd's turn. The new, self-titled album by Charlie Louvin (his brother and partner, Ira, died in 1965), fragile of voice but not of spirit at age 79, features Elvis Costello and members of Wilco, Bright Eyes, Lambchop and Clem Snide in spare, affectionate duets. Laura Cantrell, the sweetheart of the alt-country rodeo, opens the show. At 8 p.m., Gramercy Theater, 127 East 23rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; $16.50 in advance, $18 at the door. (Sisario) MOONLIGHTERS (Monday) Few would expect members of Helmet and the Pain Teens to play ukulele-strumming, steel-guitar-sliding, sweetly harmonized, optimistic Hawaiian-style songs. But the Moonlighters do just that, writing anachronistic ballads and swing-style tunes that Bliss Blood sings without a hint of campiness. At 10 p.m., Rodeo Bar, 375 Third Avenue, at 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 683-6500, rodeobar.com; free. (Pareles) NICKELBACK (Monday) This quartet of Marlboro men from the tiny Canadian prairie town of Hanna, Alberta, scored the fourth-best-selling album of 2006 with ''All the Right Reasons'' (Roadrunner), whose painfully ordinary commercial rock has one big (and super-popular) standout: ''Photograph,'' a post-grunge ballad the way Ray Davies would write one, tangy and reflective. With Three Days Grace and Breaking Benjamin. At 7 p.m., Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900, meadowlands.com; $41.50 and $51.50. (Sisario) * ELVIS PERKINS (Sunday) Having established himself on the singer-songwriter circuit with a discursive acoustic style derived from groups like Clem Snide, Mr. Perkins has finally released his bittersweet and beautiful debut album, ''Ash Wednesday'' (XL). He began it in 2002, a decade after his father, the actor Anthony Perkins, died of AIDS, and a year after his mother, the fashion photographer Berry Berenson Perkins, died in one of the planes that was crashed into the World Trade Center on Sept. 11. With Patrick Watson. At 7:30 p.m., Luna Lounge, 361 Metropolitan Avenue, at Havemeyer Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, lunalounge.com; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. (Sisario) RADIO 4, TEDDYBEARS (Tonight) Radio 4 was among the first local bands to mine the frantic dance-punk of early-'80s groups like the Gang of Four and Public Image Ltd., which it does studiously but not very imaginatively. The Teddybears, from Sweden, have one of the year's bigger head-scratchers with ''Punkrocker,'' a paranoid jaunt with new-wave synthesizers and a deadpan vocal by Iggy Pop that is being used in a Cadillac ad -- makes perfect sense, right? At 11:30, Studio B, 259 Banker Street, between Meserole Avenue and Calyer Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 389-1880, clubstudiob.com; $10. (Sisario) IKE REILLY ASSASSINATION (Tonight) An eloquent wiseguy whose songs evoke Bob Dylan and Paul Westerberg, Mr. Reilly, a former bellhop and gravedigger from Chicago, has the kind of high-energy, hook-heavy folk-rock sound that turns every head in a bar, while his nasal vocals are unsparingly sardonic: ''The friends that you rely on are the train tracks that you lie on.'' At midnight, Mo Pitkin's, 34 Avenue A, near Third Street, East Village, (212) 777-5660, mopitkins.com; $15. (Sisario) SCISSOR SISTERS (Tomorrow) You would be forgiven if you didn't know this was one of the most popular New York City bands in the world: despite Top 10 success in Britain with its almost parodically falsetto-heavy disco-soul, the Scissor Sisters have struggled for attention at home. Its main songwriters, the singer Jake Shears and the bassist Babbydaddy, can crank out some very entertaining dance-floor anthems, but as its latest album, ''Ta-Dah'' (Universal), makes clear, this sound can go on forever without much development, and the Bee Gees and George Michael wrote better songs. At 8 p.m., the Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $41. (Sisario) STEEL PULSE (Tuesday) The close harmonies and steadfast reggae beats of Steel Pulse have carried righteous sentiments about topics including revolution, dancing, Rastafarianism and racist taxi drivers.

(Sisario) * THERMALS (Sunday and Monday) A lo-fi but high-energy and high-volume indie band from Portland, Ore., the Thermals have the rare distinction -- maybe soon to be less rare in this post-''Inconvenient Truth'' era -- of refusing $50,000 to license a song for a Hummer commercial. (''What would you be making an ad for,'' the singer Hutch Harris told the Web site Pitchfork, ''a new tank that people can drive down the street?'') With the Big Sleep. Sunday at 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out.

(Sisario) WALKMEN (Thursday) The Walkmen play exquisitely articulated songs of exhaustion and disaffection, with Hamilton Leithauser's weary whine surrounded by an echoey wash of guitar and keyboards. Last fall they also revealed a surprising prankster side with a song-by-song cover of ''Pussy Cats,'' the bizarre, boozy 1974 album by Harry Nilsson that was a product of his ''lost weekend'' period with John Lennon. With the Broken West and Ferrababy Lionheart. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out.

Opera * 'EUGENE ONEGIN' (Tomorrow) The final performance this season of the Metropolitan Opera's affecting revival of its 1997 production of Tchaikovsky's ''Eugene Onegin'' comes tomorrow night. In his first Met performances of the title role, the charismatic Russian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky is riveting, singing with earthy richness and fully conveying this worldly, entitled and dashing young man's aloofness, until the final tragic scene. The surprises come from the soprano Ren\u00e9e Fleming, in her first Russian role at the Met, who gives a vocally exquisite and vulnerable portrayal of Tatiana, and the tenor Ram\u00f3n Vargas, a Bel Canto specialist, who makes an ardent and endearing Lenski, Onegin's well-meaning but fatally impulsive friend. You will seldom see better acting in opera than from this excellent cast. Taking over for Valery Gergiev, Paul Nadler conducts. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anthony Tommasini) 'LA FORZA DEL DESTINO' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Some people, faced with a theater that seats 100 people, would stage chamber opera. But the tiny Amato Opera endears precisely because it refuses to recognize realistic limits, preferring to lose itself in a haze of opera idolatry. This weekend, therefore, it brings back its staging of one of Verdi's largest works, for some of Verdi's largest singers; probably a few people in the company's perennially rotating casts will even do the spirit of the music justice. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 2:30 p.m., 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200, amato.org; $35; $28 for students and 65+. (Anne Midgette) * 'DIE MEISTERSINGER VON N\u00dcRNBERG' (Monday) Otto Schenk's stylistically realistic and captivating 1993 production of Wagner's humanely comic masterpiece is back in the repertory. That this score is a James Levine specialty is just one reason to expect the best from this revival. The veteran bass James Morris, acclaimed for his affecting portrayal of the wise and conflicted shoemaker Hans Sachs, is back, along with the powerhouse tenor Johan Botha as the young knight Walther, a role he has sung splendidly at the house. Branching out, the fine soprano Hei-Kyung Hong sings Eva for the first time at the Met. At 6 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $175.

(Bernard Holland) 'LA TRAVIATA' (Wednesday) For its revival of Verdi's ''Traviata,'' in Franco Zeffirelli's extravagant 1998 production, the Met is rotating casts, with three sopranos sharing the role of Violetta this season. The earthy Bulgarian soprano Krassimira Stoyanova, who made her Met debut in 2001 and who was recently heard at the house as Nedda in ''Pagliacci,'' sings Violetta, the role of her debut. The compelling German tenor Jonas Kaufmann sings Alfredo, Violetta's impulsive lover, with the veteran American baritone Dwayne Croft as Alfredo's tragically interfering father, Germont. Marco Armiliato conducts. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $65 to $175. (Tommasini) 'DIE ZAUBERFL\u00d6TE' (Tonight and Thursday) The revival of Julie Taymor's production of Mozart's ''Zauberfl\u00f6te'' continues at the Met, complete with the magical puppets and stage effects that made it an audience hit when it opened in 2004.

At 5 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $58 and $68. (Holland) METROPOLITAN MUSEUM ARTISTS IN CONCERT (Tonight) Members of the Metropolitan Museum's resident chamber group present a program featuring Schubert's Five German Dances, Seven Trios and Coda for String Quartet (D. 90); Kodaly's Duo for Violin and Cello (Op. 7); Kurtag's 12 Microludes for String Quartet (Op. 13); and Brahms's String Quintet in G (Op. 111). The musicians are Edward Arron, cellist; Nicholas Cords, violist; Jennifer Frautschi and Yosuke Kawasaki, violinists; and Colin Jacobsen, violinist and violist. At 8, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $30. (Schweitzer) MUSIC FROM JAPAN (Tomorrow and Sunday) Joji Yuasa is a veteran composer; an erstwhile colleague of Takemitsu; a professor emeritus at the University of California, San Diego; and the subject of a retrospective tomorrow that will include a world premiere. The biwa is a kind of lute (not unlike the Chinese pipa), which the player-singer Junko Tahara has formed into a distinctive ensemble that will perform everything from a brand-new work by Masataka Matsuo to a medieval epic called ''The Tale of the Heike'' on Sunday afternoon. Both are part of the small Music From Japan festival, which offers a compact look at musical worlds many of us still don't know well enough. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, kaufman-center.org; $20, or $35 for both concerts. (Midgette) NEW YORK CONSORT OF VIOLS (Sunday) This expert early-music ensemble, joined by a choir of men and boys, offers medieval and Renaissance works from Spain. At 3 p.m., Church of the Transfiguration, 1 East 29th Street, Manhattan, (212) 684-4174, josephpan.com/nycv; $20 in advance; $25 at the door; $15 for students and 65+. (Kozinn) ORION STRING QUARTET (Wednesday) Under the auspices of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, the Orion players honor one of America's distinguished composers when they play four string quartets by Leon Kirchner. At 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org; $30 to $52. (Holland) * THOMAS QUASTHOFF (Monday and Wednesday) Mr. Quasthoff is reputed to be as gifted a teacher as he is a recitalist, and with his latest recording, ''The Jazz Album: Watch What Happens'' (Deutsche Grammophon), he aims to show that he is as gifted a jazz singer as a classical one. He will demonstrate several facets this week at Carnegie Hall. On Monday a program at Zankel Hall called ''Thomas Quasthoff and the Art of Song'' will showcase some of his best current students in Berlin; on Wednesday he takes the main stage with a jazz combo for a concert of his own. Unusual, perhaps, but it could also be pretty hot. Monday at 7:30 p.m., Wednesday at 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $15 for Monday; $18 to $64 for Wednesday. (Midgette) * MICHAEL SCHADE (Tuesday) The dulcet-voiced Swiss-born tenor Michael Schade, an artist especially noted for his Mozart roles in the opera house, is also an elegant lieder singer. For his unusual song recital at Zankel Hall with the pianist Malcolm Martineau, Mr. Schade will focus on the German Romantic poet Joseph von Eichendorff, as set to music by Schumann, Mendelssohn, Brahms and Wolf. While in New York, Mr. Schade is also appearing as Tamino in the Metropolitan Opera's production of ''Die Zauberfl\u00f6te.'' At 7:30 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $36 to $42. (Tommasini) VIENNA PHILHARMONIC (Tonight through Sunday) These days the Vienna Philharmonic is as famous for its resistance to hiring women as for its playing, but let's not forget that purely as a music-making machine, it's a glorious thing. Daniel Barenboim leads it in three concerts: Schubert and Bruckner symphonies tonight; all Bartok (including the Second Piano Concerto with Lang Lang) tomorrow; and the Schumann Fourth Symphony and orchestral music from Wagner operas on Sunday. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 2, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $51 to $200. (Kozinn) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. LES BALLETS TROCKADERO DE MONTE CARLO (Tomorrow and Sunday) This zany all-male troupe of ballerinas will perform at two New York-area theaters this weekend. The ballerhinos invade Princeton tomorrow at 8 p.m. McCarter Theater Center, 91 University Place, Princeton, N.J., (609) 258-2787, mccarter.org; $32 to $38. Then they will chass\u00e9 on to Newark for a performance on Sunday at 3 p.m. New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722, njpac.org; $20 to $58. (Jennifer Dunning) * DANCE AT DNA (Tomorrow and Thursday) Amy Pivar, known for brainy, powerfully emotional choreography, teams up tomorrow with the mezzo-soprano Elaine Valby and the composer-performers Paula M. Kimper and Gilda Lyons for the latest installment in a five-year collaboration. The musical texts include poetry by Paul Bowles and a setting in Hebrew of the 23rd Psalm. Sharing the program are Alexandra Shilling and Ann Robideaux, who create a surreal landscape in their new ''Long Night.'' And tomorrow afternoon, six choreographers will participate in the theater's informal Works in Progress series, which consists of excerpted dance and audience feedback. Bridgman-Packer Dance will follow on Thursday, through March 11, in a dance that explores the concept of ''video partnering,'' as Art Bridgman and Myrna Packer put it. Their video collaborators are Peter Bobrow, Jim Monroe and Matthias Oostrik. On hand to provide the live music will be Robert Een, Ken Field and Glen Velez. ''Works in Progress,'' tomorrow at 5:30 p.m., $10 suggested donation; Pivar tomorrow at 8 p.m., $17; Bridgman-Packer Thursday at 8 p.m., $25. Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, TriBeCa, (212) 279-4200, dnadance.org. (Dunning) Philippe Decoufl\u00e9 (Tuesday through Thursday) This French choreographer is well known for his wonderfully entertaining and often poetic large-scale productions that blend dance, circus, music hall and theater. It's a surprise to find him performing a solo, called ''Solo: Le Doute M'Habite'' (''I Am Filled With Doubt''), but there are likely to be visual tricks, humor and theatrical magic aplenty. (Through March 11.) Tuesday and Wednesday at 7.30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $38; $29 for Joyce members. (Roslyn Sulcas) THE 4 TANGO SEASONS (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) This show explores nature's cycles as seen through a man and a woman in love. (Through April 1.) Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 3 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 4 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Thalia Spanish Theater, 41-17 Greenpoint Avenue, Sunnyside, Queens, (718) 729-3880, thaliatheatre.org; $30; $27 for students and 65+; all tickets $25 tonight and Thursday. (Dunning) Sally Gross and Company (Tonight through Sunday night) There are a few choreographers who epitomize a certain kind of downtown spirit: dedicated, talented and tenacious. One is Ms. Gross, who has been making austere, economical dances since the 1960s and still has much to say. Two new works, ''The Pleasure of Stillness'' and ''Songs,'' a solo for Ms. Gross, are on the program, along with two pieces from last year; ''With Music #2'' and ''With Words #2.'' At 8, Joyce Soho, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 334-7479, joyce.org; $15. (Sulcas) MIGUEL GUTIERREZ AND THE POWERFUL PEOPLE (Tonight, tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday) In his new ''Everyone,'' Mr. Gutierrez examines the always topical issue of how and why a dance may be made in a world filled with incoherent current events. (Through March 11.) Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and 9:30, Sunday at 3 p.m., Wednesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m. Henry Street Settlement, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 352-3101, abronsartscenter.org; $20, $10 for students; $50 for gala program and reception on Wednesday. (Dunning) Marcia Milhazes Dance Company (Thursday) Marcia Milhazes danced with Maurice Bejart and studied at the Laban Center in London before returning to her native Brazil in 1994. Her company makes its New York debut with ''Tempo de Ver\u00e3o (Summertime),'' which a recent article in Dance Magazine described as ''cultured and trendy.'' Which could be good. (Through March 10.) At 7.30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 691-6500, dtw.org; $20; $12 for students, 65+ and artists. (Sulcas) * 92nd STREET Y HARKNESS DANCE FESTIVAL (Tomorrow, Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday) Joe Chvala and the Flying Foot Forum, a percussive-dance group from Minneapolis-St. Paul, creates rhythmic patterns with taps, found objects and vocalizing, tomorrow and Sunday. The festival continues on Wednesday with performances by the Dusan Tynek Dance Theater. Mr. Tynek, a Czech-born choreographer, has a style that is vivid and quirky in a quietly powerful folk-art way, in dances that address decidedly unusual themes. His new ''Fleur-de-lis,'' for example, a three-part reimagining of religious paintings and the emotions contained in them, is a dance set to music by the Baroque composer Heinrich Ignaz Franz von Biber. Joe Chvala and the Flying Foot Forum, tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m. Dusan Tynek Dance Theater, Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m. Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 415-5500, 92Y.org/HarknessFestival; $20; $10 for students and 65+. (Dunning) ROYSTON DANCE COMPANY (Tomorrow and Sunday) Robert Royston's new ''StreetSwing'' draws on his experiences as a multiple winner of the ballroom championships in United States Open Swing Dance and World Country Dance. Tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Queens Theater in the Park, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 760-0064, queenstheatre.org; $37; $33 for 65+; $20 for students. (Dunning) * PAUL TAYLOR DANCE COMPANY (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) The company opens its spring season tonight with the lush ''Roses,'' the jaunty yet sad ''Company B'' and Mr. Taylor's new ''Lines of Loss,'' a meditation on different kinds of loss set to eight pieces of music by composers including Guillaume de Machaut and John Cage. Popular Taylor favorites to be performed this week are the haunting ''Sunset'' (tomorrow and Wednesday nights) and the sexy and funny tango piece ''Piazzolla Caldera'' (tomorrow night), and the death-defying yet serene ''Esplanade'' (Sunday afternoon and Wednesday night). Another of the week's highlights promises to be a one-time performance of Mr. Taylor's ''Aureole,'' that luminous 1962 modern-dance classic, on Tuesday in a gala program that also includes the premiere of ''Troilus and Cressida (reduced).'' The new work may well represent the choreographer at his most wicked, set as it is to music by Ponchielli (the well-known tune for Allan Sherman's novelty song ''Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh!''). (Through March 18.) Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 3 p.m., Tuesday through Thursday at 7 p.m. City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org; $15 to $125. (Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * American Folk Art Museum: MART\u00edN RAM\u00edREZ, through April 29. Ram\u00edrez, a Mexican peasant who immigrated to Northern California and died there at 68 in 1963, spent the last 32 years of his life in a mental hospital, making some of the greatest art of the last century. He had his own way with materials and color and an unforgettable cast of characters (most notably, a mounted caballero and a levitating Madonna crowned like the Statue of Liberty.) But most of all, Ram\u00edrez had his own brand of pictorial space, established by rhythmic systems of parallel lines, both curved and straight, whose mesmerizing expansions and contractions simultaneously cosset and isolate his figures. This show should render null and void the distinction between insider and outsider art. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * American Museum of Natural History: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples -- larded with fascinating facts and tales -- ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Smith) * Asia Society: Glass, Gilding, and Grand Design: Art of Sasanian Iran (224-642 A.D.), through May 20. This glinting, glowing show is a reduction of a much larger Paris exhibition that included material from Iranian museums impossible to bring to the United States. But with some 70 examples of silver, glass and silk textile fragments, many from European museums, it is still substantial and the first major exhibition of its kind in this part of the world for more than 30 years. For about four centuries, the Sasanians ruled territory stretching from present-day Iran and Iraq to North Africa. Their only rivals were Rome, Byzantium and, at the very end, the early Islamic dynasties. Much of their surviving art is a sterling example of empire in action. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400. (Holland Cotter) Guggenheim Museum: 'Family Pictures,' through April 16. This show sounds ripe with possibilities. The results, however, are more mixed. The exhibition is drawn from the museum's collection, which explains some of its exclusions and limitations. Many artists you associate with contemporary photography and the family are not in attendance: Richard Bellingham, Tina Barney, Malerie Marder. There is also a sense of false advertising in the exhibition's title. The museum's news release extends the exhibition's exploration into ''representation of families and children in contemporary art and video.'' Images of children, you quickly realize, can operate as a completely different genre. A good portion of the work falls under this rubric. Rineke Dijkstra's ''Beach Portraits'' of adolescents posing awkwardly against stark seascape horizons are isolated (and isolating) images of children on the threshold of adulthood. You don't think about family when gazing at these photographs. Sally Mann is perhaps the best-known contemporary photographer of children, specifically her own. Ms. Mann, represented here by black-and-white photographs from the late 1980s and early 1990s of her ethereally gorgeous children (now grown), has been accused of everything from neglect to child abuse. The questions raised by her dual role as artist and mother, simultaneous protector and potential exploiter of the family, and her choice of family as the central focus of artistic practice, remain vitally interesting. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Martha Schwendener) FRICK COLLECTION: 'GEORGE STUBBS (1724-1806): A CELEBRATION,' through May 27. One of the finest horse painters ever, Stubbs knew his subjects from head to hoof and skin to bones, having dissected them for his famous study ''The Anatomy of the Horse'' (1766). He's best known for his views of aristocratic race horses, seen purely as beautiful animals with no attempt at anthropomorphosis, but he painted other mammals too, dogs, lions, tigers, oxen, monkeys and humans. This intimate show of 17 Stubbs paintings from English collections reveals his admirable range, although the people he portrayed in two large, late canvases, elegiac celebrations of farm workers raking and reaping grain, have the stiffness of figures on a candy box. His horses are his true monuments. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700. (Grace Glueck) International Center of Photography: 'Henri Cartier-Bresson's Scrapbook: Photographs, 1932-46,' through April 29. Arrived by way of the Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson in Paris, this show has more than 300 of the prints the photographer glued into an album and toted to New York for curators at the Museum of Modern Art to cull. Captured by the Nazis, he had been presumed dead when the Modern planned his retrospective. Then he turned up alive -- the ''posthumous'' exhibition opened, with him in attendance, in 1947. The current exhibition reconstructs as best as possible the original layout of the scrapbook. It's an eye-straining affair, but it surveys the revolutionary work he shot in Spain, Italy, Mexico, Britain and France. His taste for uncanny detail linked him to Surrealism and Surrealist wit, but unlike many Surrealists, he remained committed to human values. Boys mug at his camera. Prostitutes swan. Their gazes equalize them with us. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Michael Kimmelman) International Center of Photography: 'Martin Munkacsi: Think While You Shoot!' through April 29. Munkacsi, who inspired Cartier-Bresson, was, by contrast, self-taught, a creature of his own devising. This is the most complete retrospective, with a thick catalog (not too well researched) and dozens of vintage prints from the 1920s through the early '60s. He favored scenes of daily life, absorbing avant-garde ideas about odd angles and abstract compositions. In 1928 he moved to Berlin and traveled the world on assignment to Brazil, Algeria and Egypt. Munkacsi was a stylist, and he made catchy images the only way he knew how, in a modernist mode, which, being an opportunistic form, could serve any master. (See above.) (Kimmelman) * The METropOlitan museum of art: 'ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,' through Sept. 3. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92), portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht Durer, and Bonnie Seeman's fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Glueck) * Morgan Library & Museum: 'Private Treasures: Four Centuries of European Master Drawings,' through April 8. This show is drawn entirely from an anonymous private collection. Despite the veil of secrecy, a couple of things are obvious: the collector had significant capital for investing in old masters and either an exceptional eye or a good adviser (or both). The works span more than 400 years, from the 16th to the early 20th century, and include drawings in ink and pencil, watercolor, chalk and gouache. The earliest works come from a period when drawing wasn't an autonomous practice but was used as a form of exercise, to apply one's craft, to experiment and to make preliminary sketches for larger works. The best example -- and the most historically significant work here -- is a black chalk drawing, ''The Dead Christ'' (1529-35), by Agnolo Bronzino. With more than 90 drawings in the show, being a diligent observer quickly becomes exhausting. In which case, put down the guide, find a few drawings you like, and enjoy them while you can. After all, you don't know where they came from, where they're going, or when you'll see them again. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Schwendener) Museum of Modern Art: 'Artistic Collaborations: 50 Years of Universal Limited Art Editions,' through May 21. This exhibition marks the half-century milestone for Universal Limited Art Editions in West Islip, N.Y., and its association with the Museum of Modern Art: The museum has acquired one print from every edition made at Universal, more than 1,200 works by nearly 50 artists. Prints by 12 artists are in this show. Among them are lithographs by Jasper Johns, mostly from the 1960s, with his signature maps and flags. Robert Rauschenberg is represented primarily by lithographs from the 1960s that combine found images of figures like John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson with the freehand scrawling associated with Abstract Expressionism. It's hard to fault an exhibition that features prints by masters like Mr. Johns and Mr. Rauschenberg. But given the somewhat precarious position of prints in the contemporary art world, the inclusion of younger artists would make a good argument that traditional printmaking is still relevant and holds possibilities for this generation. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Schwendener) * MOMA: Armando Rever\u00d3n, through April 16. Unless you spotted his single smoke-puff of a painting at MoMA months ago, Armando Rever\u00f3n probably means nothing to you. Why should he? The artist, who died in 1954, spent most of his life in a shack by the sea in his native Venezuela. Many of his contemporaries dismissed him as nuts. His white-on-white pictures are practically unphotographable. But chances are that if you visit this retrospective, you'll find yourself thinking about him a lot. His art and his story are like few others, and so is the museum's inspired installation: a single, longcorridor with cabinetlike rooms of paintings on either side and, at the very end, against a sea-green wall, a life-size doll with giant bat wings floating overhead. (See above.) (Cotter) * National Academy Museum: HIGH TIMES, HARD TIMES: NEW YORK PAINTING, 1967-1975, through April 22. Organized under the auspices of International Curators Incorporated, this brave if confused exhibition is the first to tackle a neglected subject: New York painting during the period it was supposed to be dead. The show's 42 works by 37 artists reveal that, far from dead, painting was in fact in an uproar that was commensurate with the artistic, social and political turbulence of the times. The alternation between artists who remained loyal in their way to stretched canvas and those who abandoned it, which makes for clear installation, also tidies up history. The main problem is that the exhibition sticks too purposefully to the margins, mixing generations and levels of achievement and continuing the neglect of the main story. Too much of this work is as derivative now as it was then, and functions more as artifact than art. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Smith) Galleries: Chelsea * BAKER OVERSTREET: NEW PAINTINGS Like Keegan McHargue and Devendra Banhart, this young artist has a penchant for tribal motifs, which he flattens into symmetrical compositions and renders with an outsider roughness. The works in his debut show evoke the imagery of the space-ship-obsessed, self-taught artist Ionel Talpazan, as well as Alfred Jensen and Forrest Bess. Their notion of the visionary is both self conscious and familiar, but they are painted with energetic dispatch and a sure sense of scale, color and wit that encourages you to stay tuned. Fredericks & Freiser, 536 West 24th Street, (212) 633-6555, through March 17. (Smith) Last Chance Dia:Beacon: 'Agnes Martin: A Field of Vision: Paintings from the 1980's,' Dia:Beacon, a bulwark of Minimalism on the banks of the Hudson River north of Manhattan, has three permanent galleries devoted to the artist Agnes Martin. Over the last two years they have been used for a retrospective of her paintings, installed in decade-long increments. The fourth installment is now in place. If Ms. Martin's spare, lucid compositions of drawn lines and painted bands feel different from much of the art around them here, that is because she was not a Minimalist. In fact, she called herself an Abstract Expressionist, and she was adamant on this point. The 18 paintings here confirm her conviction, in a show as deep, light-glinting, restless and purposeful as the river flowing nearby. Dia:Beacon, Riggio Galleries, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, www.diacenter.org; closes on Monday. (Cotter) * MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'SAUL STEINBERG: ILLUMINATIONS,' A cartoonist-artist extraordinaire, Saul Steinberg (1914-99) was a veritable Leonardo of graphic drollery. His famous New Yorker cover positioning Manhattan at the center of the world may be his best-known drawing, but he took on everything -- Floridians, linguistic concepts, erotica, cowboys, Cubism, nature, architecture and women -- with visual puns, manic doodles, grandiloquent calligraphy and other inspired artifice. As this show of more than 100 Steinberg drawings, collages and constructions goes on, Steinberg's progress is evident: from relatively simple cartoons like ''Feet on Chair'' (1946), in which a fellow reading a newspaper parks his feet on the seat of an ornate Victorian monstrosity, to complex comments on the state of the world, like ''Street War (Cadavre Exquisis)'' (about 1972-74), derived from news clips of postcolonial troubles in the Middle East and Africa (and possibly influenced by his growing interest in underground comix), a premonitory take on the precarious situation of the world today. The flow of his work amazes. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org; closes on Sunday. (Glueck) * Spectral Evidence This group show, organized by the sharp young artist Steven Lam, is about the hard shell of illusion that surrounds official history, and about art's attempt to crack open that shell. These histories range from lynchings and United States government surveillance in the 1930s, to propaganda and the Vietnam War in the 1960s, to the destruction of the Buddhist sculptures at Bamiyan in the 2000s. Terry Adkins, Jill Godmilow, Sreshta Rit Premnath and Elaine Reichek are among the artists who explore the authenticity of ''facts'' woven from ideology and desire. Rotunda Gallery, 33 Clinton Street, near Pierrepont Street, Brooklyn Heights, (718) 875-4047; closes tomorrow.
