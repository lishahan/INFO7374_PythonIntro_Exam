It was one of dozens of custom-made pieces from the atelier of George Smith, a leading English furniture designer, that were transforming a cavernous 1920s mansion, top left, in the Hollywood Hills into an intimate British-style club for a select group of guests in the days before the Academy Awards. The club is a weeklong outpost of the Soho House hotel-clubs of New York and London that opened on Monday. It includes a spa, lower right, and a paneled study with a 12-foot-long Victorian-style tufted leather couch, lower left, matched with spare '70s-inspired coffee tables from a local prop house. The dining room is draped in floor-to-ceiling midnight-blue fabric and has sea grass under foot. It leads out to a stone balcony, top right, whose ceiling is hung with artfully bunched white fabric and crystal chandeliers. Upstairs a billiards room has been redone with black wallpaper imprinted with Scottish thistles, while the sconces are antlers tipped with electric lights.", "abstract": "Select group of guests is pampered at British-style club set up by SoHo House in Hollywood Hill for week running up to Academy Awards; photos (S)", "print_page": "3", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "A Club That Will Barely Last Longer Than an Oscar Acceptance Speech", "kicker": "CURRENTS: MAKEOVER"}, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "SOHO HOUSE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ACADEMY AWARDS (OSCARS)"}], "pub_date": "2007-02-22T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "House & Home/Style Desk", "section_name": "Movies; Home and Garden; Style", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Sharon", "lastname": "WAXMAN"}], "original": "By SHARON WAXMAN"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd2b0388eb7c8105d89fa8f", "word_count": 293, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/video/movies/1194817116066/oscar-excitement-reaches-uganda.html", "snippet": "Forest Whitaker was in Kampala, Uganda, for the premiere of the movie \"The Last King of Scotland,\" which depicts the reign of dictator Idi Amin....", "lead_paragraph": "Forest Whitaker was in Kampala, Uganda, for the premiere of the movie \"The Last King of Scotland,\" which depicts the reign of dictator Idi Amin.", "abstract": null, "print_page": null, "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [{"width": 190, "url": "images/2007/02/21/movies/feb21WorldUgandaG.190x126.fr.jpg", "height": 126, "subtype": "wide", "legacy": {"wide": "images/2007/02/21/movies/feb21WorldUgandaG.190x126.fr.jpg", "wideheight": "126", "widewidth": "190"}, "type": "image"}, {"width": 75, "url": "images/2007/02/21/movies/feb21WorldUgandaG.75x75.fr.jpg", "height": 75, "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"thumbnailheight": "75", "thumbnail": "images/2007/02/21/movies/feb21WorldUgandaG.75x75.fr.jpg", "thumbnailwidth": "75"}, "type": "image"}], "headline": {"main": "Oscar Excitement Reaches Uganda", "sub": "'The Last King of Scotland' Opens"}, "keywords": [{"rank": "1", "is_major": "N", "name": "subject", "value": "Academy Awards (Oscars)"}, {"rank": "2", "is_major": "N", "name": "subject", "value": "Motion Pictures"}], "pub_date": "2007-02-21T18:55:43Z", "document_type": "multimedia", "news_desk": "Movies", "section_name": "Movies", "subsection_name": null, "byline": null, "type_of_material": "Video", "_id": "504a72001c22dfde670b9679", "word_count": "25", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/02/21/love-sweet-love/", "snippet": "\"Crazy Love,\" the documentary that wants to become a feature film....", "lead_paragraph": "\"Who the hell wants to watch Josh Lucas blind Gwyneth Paltrow?\" Bobby Zarem, the publicist, said to the Baguette after last night'screening of Dan Klores's \"Crazy Love\" at the Brant Park Hotel.
