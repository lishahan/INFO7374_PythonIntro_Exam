(Fox) AMERICAN IDOL -- Two men and two women are sent packing.9 P.M. (Fox) THE O.C. Subtitle this one ''The End's Not Near, It's Here.'' Tonight, in this series finale, the pretty people of Orange County bid adieu six months after an earthquake rocked Newport, and viewers find out what ever happened to the Cohens, the Coopers, and the rest. 8 P.M. (VH1) BLING'D: BLOOD, DIAMONDS AND HIP-HOP -- Last summer, the hip-hop artists Paul Wall, Raekwon of Wu Tang Clan, and Tego Calderon traveled to Sierra Leone to look at the diamond trade, which has devastated communities, forced women, children (above, with Mr. Wall in Kono) and the elderly into being miners and helped finance the country's civil war. Back in the United States, Kanye West, Jadakiss, Big Daddy Kane, Juelz Santana, Chris Aire and Mr. T come to terms with what it means to wear bling in the American hip-hop world.

(HBO) GHOSTS OF ABU GHRAIB -- To see the pictures was to ask some uncomfortable questions -- like how did torture become an accepted practice at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq?

In this film, an official selection in the American Documentary Competition at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival, Rory Kennedy interviews Iraqi victims (above) and guards directly involved in the abuses.
