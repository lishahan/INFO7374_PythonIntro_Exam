Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Broadway 'THE APPLE TREE' The amazing Kristin Chenoweth gives Imax-screen-size life to three curvaceous doodles who by rights shouldn't be any larger than figures in the Sunday funnies. Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick's 1966 musical, directed by Gary Griffin, shows its age but is given theatrical verve by Ms. Chenoweth, Brian d'Arcy James and Marc Kudisch (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Ben Brantley) 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA' Lincoln Center Theater's brave, gorgeous, sprawling and ultimately exhilarating production of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about intellectuals errant in 19th-century Russia. A testament to the seductive powers of narrative theater, directed with hot and cool canniness by Jack O'Brien and featuring a starry cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Martha Plimpton, Josh Hamilton and Ethan Hawke, among others) in a tasty assortment of roles. Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raul Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MIS\u00c9RABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) * 'TRANSLATIONS' The estimable Irish director Garry Hynes (a Tony winner for Martin McDonagh's ''Beauty Queen of Leenane'') has assembled an ensemble of an extraordinarily high caliber and consistency for the third major New York production of Brian Friel's 1980 play. Set in rural Ireland in 1833, as the local tongue is being supplanted by the language of the English occupying forces, the play explores the seriocomic truth that language can divide as easily as it unites, and can never hope to translate the rich music in our souls with the delicacy we yearn for. A top-flight Broadway revival (2:15). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE VERTICAL HOUR' David Hare's soggy consideration of the Anglo-American cultural divide stars Julianne Moore (representing the Americans) and Bill Nighy (leading the British), directed by Sam Mendes. The Yanks don't stand a chance (2:20). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ADRIFT IN MACAO' Christopher Durang wrote the book (cute) and lyrics (crude) for this fortune-cookie-sized musical set in a Chinese port in the 1950s. Flimsy but fun, this spoof of old movies is lovingly acted by a swell cast, although an hour after it's over, you may be hungry for reruns of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'ALL THAT I WILL EVER BE' In this false-feeling comedy-drama by Alan Ball, creator of ''Six Feet Under,'' a gay hustler undergoes an identity crisis when he finds himself falling for one of his clients. Slick but mostly stale in its analysis of a society afraid of emotional engagement (2:15). The New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'BLIND LEMON BLUES' An exuberant musical tribute to Blind Lemon Jefferson, arguably the biggest country-blues musician of the 1920s. The facts of his life are vague, and as a result, the narrative is almost dreamlike. A delightful evening (1:50). Theater at St. Peter's, 619 Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212) 935-5820. (Ginia Bellafante) 'THE FEVER' Wallace Shawn performs his provocative monologue about a guilt-riddled bourgeois everyman sweating his way through a moral crisis. The rich, often hypnotic writing draws us into his tortured mindscape, as he shifts between shame over his sense of entitlement and reasoned arguments that sacrifice is unnecessary and pointless. Meanwhile, in the third world, the violence and poverty continue unabated (1:30). Acorn Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time. The excellent duo Jeremy Shamos and Christopher Fitzgerald make the pitch (2:05). The Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman) * 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of vibrant, funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'THE LAST WORD ' Oren Safdie's comedy about cultural generation gaps amuses as it goes along but lands at a predictable nowhere. Daniel J. Travanti stars as a Viennese Jew and aspiring playwright who does battle with a young student angling to become his writing assistant and find his voice (1:30). Theater at St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante) 'THE MADRAS HOUSE' A century-old drama about ''the woman question,'' this rare revival of Harley Granville Barker's fascinating play is more contemporary than you might think (2:30). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. ( Zinoman) 'MARAT/SADE' The first New York production of Peter Weiss's classic 1963 play captures the rawness and shock of the original with a harrowing production. The inmates of this all-male asylum fling themselves against the chain-links of their enclosure; realistic-looking vomit and feces feature in one key scene; the audience is sprayed with water from the attendants' hoses and reminded that theater is not always a safe place. It's undeniably powerful; unfortunately, it remains a blunt instrument rather than a polished one, since the language is not mined as deeply as the emotion. Marat and Sade's philosophical debate, and the play's topicality, tend to be obscured by the sheer brute force of what's happening onstage (2:10). The Classical Theater of Harlem, Harlem School of the Arts Theater, 647 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, (212) 868-4444. (Anne Midgette) 'MARY ROSE' J. M. Barrie penned this distaff variation on themes from ''Peter Pan'' in 1920, and it has mostly lain on the shelf since. A young English girl (an exuberant Paige Howard) acquires the odd habit of disappearing and reappearing some time later, untouched by time's passing. Gentle and melancholy, handsomely mounted by Tina Landau, ''Mary Rose'' is nonetheless itself touched by the mark of time (1:45). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303. (Isherwood) 'THE MERCHANT OF VENICE' and 'THE JEW OF MALTA' F. Murray Abraham plays two Elizabethan villains in repertory for the Theater for a New Audience. Mr. Abraham's sinister but still moving Shylock is the dark heart of Darko Tresnjak's chilly, powerful staging of one of Shakespeare's unfunniest comedies. As Barabas in David Herskovits's goofy, postmodern ''Jew of Malta,'' he's the lively center of a carnival that doesn't do justice to Christopher Marlowe's harsh satire on Christian hypocrisy and venality (each 2:30). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'A SPANISH PLAY' The great Zoe Caldwell returns to the New York stage after an absence of a decade, in the fine company of Linda Emond, Denis O'Hare and Larry Pine. That's the good news. The bad? The play. Yasmina Reza's pseudo-philosophical and metatheatrical trifle is utterly forgettable (1:50). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban) 'A VERY COMMON PROCEDURE' Courtney Baron's play suffers from a very common problem: For at least half of this one-act's running time, the characters onstage are talking to us, not one another. Paradoxically, this intimacy between audience and actors keeps the story -- an odd love affair between a woman grieving the death of her baby and the doctor involved in the baby's death -- at arm's length (1:20). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) * 'THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE' David Mamet has cleanly and cannily adapted Harley Granville Barker's 1905 play about corruption in the genteel world of Victorian finance. An excellent cast and a sumptuous production bring extra immediacy to a tale of embezzlement and entitlement that feels as fresh as tomorrow's stock options (1:50). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'WAKE UP MR. SLEEPY! YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS DEAD!' Richard Foreman's latest film-theater hybrid is a memorial service, of sorts, for the intuitive self, killed by a surface-worshiping world. It is also a dazzling exercise in reality shifting that is as invigorating as it is mournful (1:05). Ontological Theater at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway 'AT LEAST IT'S PINK' Bridget Everett and her big, bad attitude co-star in this mini-musical about sex and unsatisfying jobs in the city. Directed by Michael Patrick King (of ''Sex and the City,'' as it happens), who is also the co-author, and with songs written by Ms. Everett and Kenny Mellman, the piano-playing half of Kiki & Herb. Raucous and rude, it's a bit like a one-woman episode of ''Jerry Springer'' (1:20). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood) 'NELSON' Three arresting performances catch your attention in this creepy play by Sam Marks about a young man who is an office flunky by day but films gang videos at night. But having set a lot of intriguing things in motion, Mr. Marks is afraid to let them collide head-on (1:10). The Lion Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Neil Genzlinger) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing CliffsNotes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Often more entertaining than the real thing (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 254 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'THE CRYING WOMAN' An imaginative play that manages to transform what begins as a tired culture-clash comedy involving a Mexican and United States couple sharing a house in Mexico City into a sinister tale involving strange superstitions and a ghost from the 16th century (2:30). The Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes tomorrow. (Wilborn Hampton) 'DAI (ENOUGH)' Iris Bahr's unnerving one-woman show doesn't have much to add to the Middle East debate, but it sure leaves a lasting impression. Ms. Bahr plays an assortment of characters who have the misfortune of being in a Tel Aviv cafe that is about to be visited by the havoc common to such establishments. The attack is rendered in jarring fashion, repeatedly; you watch the play on pins and needles, waiting for the next burst. Gimmicky? Sure. But viscerally effective (1:40). Culture Project, 55 Mercer Street, at Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 253-9983; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'DUTCHMAN' A revival of the poet Amiri Baraka's screed on race and American values, 43 years after its Greenwich Village debut, aims for all the fire and might of a Malcolm X speech but none of the rhetorical elegance. It shouts so loudly that you can't hear a thing (1:00). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village (212) 239-6200; closes tomorrow. (Bellafante) 'THE FRUGAL REPAST' This sweet, compact story by Ron Hirsen dabbles in the high concepts of art, but not too deeply, which makes it just right. Two circus performers see Picasso's ''Frugal Repast'' in a dealer's window and realize they were the models for it; when they steal the print, their lowbrow world and Picasso's highbrow one amusingly collide (1:20). The June Havoc Theater, Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men and two women perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'LOOKINGGLASS ALICE' Eyecatching entertainment (1:30). The New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM' Shakespeare's comedy, so dependent on things that aren't what they appear to be, makes an inspired choice for Theater by the Blind, a group that mixes blind, vision-impaired and fully sighted actors. The most intriguing thing, though, is how the company stages the play with just six actors (1:50). The Barrow Group Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'THE SECRET OF MME. BONNARD'S BATH' A dutiful bio-play about the French symbolist Pierre Bonnard is a ''Behind the Music'' for the art history set (2:00). The Kirk Theater, Theater Row Studios, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes tomorrow. ( Zinoman) 'VICTORIA MARTIN: MATH TEAM QUEEN' Must all stage teenagers speak in that exaggerated surfer-dude style in which ''awesome'' and ''totally'' make up about 50 percent of any conversation? Yes, apparently they must, from the evidence presented in this thin comedy, which is about a high school girl who finds herself on the all-male math team. The playwright, Kathryn Walat, seems to have been trying to grab the coattails of a certain spelling-bee-related show. She missed (2:00). The Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; closes on Thursday. (Genzlinger) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'AVENUE MONTAIGNE' (PG-13, 100 minutes, in French) A humble pleasure about love and art, about passing time and time passing, from the French director Dani\u00e8le Thompson, who populates one Parisian street with minor incidents, comic faces, choreographed nonsense and melodramatic blips and swells. (Manohla Dargis) 'BABEL' (R, 143 minutes, in English, Spanish, Japanese, Berber, Arabic and sign language) This hugely ambitious movie tells four loosely linked, not quite simultaneous stories set on three different continents, with dialogue in several languages. The themes, to the extent they are decipherable, include loss, fate and the terrible consequences of miscommunication. Written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, the movie is an intellectual muddle but a visceral tour de force, and the power of the filmmaking almost overcomes the fuzziness of the ideas. Almost. (A. O. Scott) * 'BAMAKO' (No rating, 118 minutes, in French and Bambara) Abdelrahmane Sissako's new film is an indictment of the West's complicity in Africa's misery, staged as a public trial of the World Bank and its affiliates. The film's passionate didacticism is both enriched and subverted by Mr. Sissako's deft, subtle attention to the details of daily life in the capital of Mali, where the movie takes place. (Scott) 'BLOOD DIAMOND' (R, 138 minutes) The makers of this foolish thriller about illegal diamond trafficking in Africa, starring an excellent Leonardo DiCaprio, want you to know there may be blood on your hands, specifically your wedding finger. Too bad they haven't thought through what it means to turn misery into entertainment. (Dargis) 'BREACH' (PG-13, 110 minutes) In his fine, no-nonsense account of the capture of the F.B.I. agent turned mole Robert Philip Hanssen, the director Billy Ray manages to excite and unnerve despite our knowing the ending. Chris Cooper and Ryan Phillippe star. (Dargis) * 'BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA' (PG, 95 minutes) Grounded more in reality than in fantasy, this smart adaptation of Katherine Paterson's award-winning novel offers an affecting story of a transformative friendship between two unusually gifted children. Beautifully capturing a time when a bully in school can loom as large as a troll in a nightmare, the director, Gabor Csupo, keeps the fantasy in the background to find magic in the everyday. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'CHILDREN OF MEN' (R, 100 minutes) The end is nigh in this superb thriller directed by Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n about a nervously plausible future. Based on the P. D. James book, the film stars an excellent Clive Owen and features equally sterling support from Michael Caine, Danny Huston and Chiwetel Ejiofior, among others. (Dargis) 'CLOSE TO HOME' (No rating, 94 minutes, in Hebrew) This movie minutely scrutinizes the daily routine of two spirited women, both 18-year-old conscripts in the Israeli army, who work as a team patrolling the streets of Jerusalem. It adopts the tunnel vision of impatient, self-centered soldiers gritting their teeth as they fulfill their two-year military obligation. (Stephen Holden) * 'DAYS OF GLORY' (R, 120 minutes, in French) Rachid Bouchareb's tale of North African soldiers fighting to free their French colonial masters from German Occupation during World War II is a potent combat picture, and also a searching and complex political drama. (Scott) * 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis) 'DREAMGIRLS' (PG-13, 131 minutes) The Broadway musical arrives on the screen, capably directed by Bill Condon, ardently acted and sung by Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy, Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles and (especially) Jennifer Hudson, but undone by mediocre and anachronistic songs. (Scott) 'FACTORY GIRL' (R, 91 minutes) It's not entirely inappropriate that this film, George Hickenlooper's biography of Edie Sedgwick, the most glamorous of Andy Warhol's so-called superstars, should suggest a magazine layout masquerading as a film. The world through which Ms. Sedgwick (Sienna Miller) blazed and burned out was one that lived and died by the camera. It existed to be seen and drooled over. But God help you if you actually lived in it. (Holden) 'GHOST RIDER' (PG-13, 114 minutes) After a long string of flops, Nicolas Cage returns to play Johnny Blaze, a stunt motorcycle rider whose soul belongs to the Devil. Despite the promise of the first 30 minutes -- when Johnny is played by the charming young actor Matt Long -- a witless script and a central character who's more funny than frightening suggest that the filmmakers' franchise hopes may be dashed. (Catsoulis) 'GRBAVICA: THE LAND OF MY DREAMS' (No rating, 90 minutes, in Bosnian) In a neighborhood of Sarajevo that was the site of a notorious prison camp, a single mother lives with her tomboyish 12-year-old daughter. The tension between the present and the recent past is embodied in the volatile relationship between mother and daughter, which comes to a boil over the issue of the girl's paternity. (Holden) 'HANNIBAL RISING' (R, 121 minutes) Marked by too much respect and too little energy, this primer on the early years of Hannibal Lecter reduces one of our most mythic villains to a callow, dysfunctional chef. Orphaned in World War II, our psychopathic hero hunts down his family's killers and snacks on their remains. But burrowing into the id of pop culture's most repulsive gourmet demands a sanguinary glee that the director, Peter Webber, may not possess; for all the movie's spurting gore, there's no accompanying rush of blood to the head. (Catsoulis) 'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker plays the mad king, while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis) * 'LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA' (R, 141 minutes, in Japanese) Another masterwork from Clint Eastwood's astonishing late period, and one of the best war movies ever. Ken Watanabe is especially fine as the general commanding Japanese troops in the doomed defense of the island of Iwo Jima. (Scott) * 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott) * 'Little Miss Sunshine' (R, 101 minutes) A bittersweet comedy of dysfunction that takes place at the terminus of the American dream. The excellent cast includes Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano and that national treasure, Alan Arkin. (Dargis) * 'THE LIVES OF OTHERS' (R, 137 minutes, in German) Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's debut feature takes place in East Berlin in 1984, and it is a smart, moving inquiry into the moral predicament facing good people in a bad system. Ulrich M\u00fche's performance as a conscience-stricken Stasi officer is a tightly wound tour de force, and Sebastian Koch and Martina Gedeck are both superb as a playwright and his actress lover who are drawn into the cruel, absurd clutches of the Communist secret police. (Scott) 'MUSIC AND LYRICS' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Drew Barrymore and Hugh Grant phone in passable impersonations of themselves in this competent romantic comedy, which is somewhat enlivened by parodies of bad pop songs from both the 1980s and the present. (Scott) 'NORBIT' (PG-13, 97 minutes) Eddie Murphy plays a nebbish, a fat woman and a Chinese restaurant owner in this crude, sometimes mean, but often funny farce. (Scott) 'NOTES ON A SCANDAL' (R, 92 minutes) Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett play a misogynistic game of cat and mouse from which no one emerges unscathed, including the audience. Adapted by Patrick Marber from a novel by Zo\u00eb Heller and directed by Richard Eyre. (Dargis) * 'PAN'S LABYRINTH' (R, 119 minutes, in Spanish) Guillermo del Toro's tale of a young girl's ordeal in post-Civil-War fascist Spain is either a fairy tale in the guise of a political allegory or vice versa. In either case it is a moving, enchanting, strange and humane example of popular art at its very best. (Scott) 'THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) How you respond to this fairy tale in realist drag may depend on whether you find Will Smith's performances so overwhelmingly winning that you buy the idea that poverty is a function of bad luck and bad choices, and success the result of heroic toil and dreams. (Dargis) * 'THE QUEEN' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Directed by Stephen Frears from a very smart script by Peter Morgan, and starring a magnificent Helen Mirren in the title role, ''The Queen'' pries open a window in the House of Windsor around the time of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, blending fact with fiction. (Dargis) 'THE ROYAL GUARD' (No rating, 107 minutes, in Hindi) Vidhu Vinod Chopra's somber drama is a contemporary tale about the aging, devoted protector (Amitabh Bachchan) of an aristocratic family out to avenge his master's murder. Though it combines Shakespearean ambience with snatches of genre cinema (westerns, martial arts movies), the film is primarily a tribute to the singular presence of Mr. Bachchan, a monumental Bollywood legend of indisputable seriousness. (Andy Webster) '79th ANNUAL ACADEMY AWARDS NOMINATED SHORT FILMS: FEATURES AND ANIMATION' (No rating, 137 minutes) This grab bag of 5 live-action shorts and 10 animated shorts is heavy on production values but light on true idiosyncrasy, much less daring. The best of the bunch are the animated short film ''The Danish Poet,'' with the actress Liv Ullmann narrating the story of an accidental meeting between an obscure poet and a famous writer that ultimately produced a child, and the live-action ''Eramos Pocos (One Too Many),'' in which a husband deals with his wife's sudden disappearance by convincing his mother-in-law to become his maid. (Matt Zoller Seitz) 'VENUS' (R, 91 minutes) A modest, diverting, touching tale of a young woman who attracts the interest -- avuncular and also erotic -- of an aging actor, played with effortless aplomb by the great Peter O'Toole. (Scott) * 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Almod\u00f3var, with Pen\u00e9lope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott) Film Series BELA TARR TRILOGY (Tonight through Sunday) The Hungarian filmmaker Bela Tarr makes dark, damp and moody dramas, usually set in bleak small towns where long takes and elaborate camera movements are used to unite the inarticulate characters in webs of lust and deceit. Three of his most critically celebrated films are based on the work of the novelist Laszlo Krasznahorkai, and all will be presented this weekend at the BAMcin\u00e9matek in Brooklyn: ''Damnation'' (1988) today; the 450-minute ''Satantango''(1994) on Saturday; and Mr. Tarr's most recent effort, ''Werckmeister Harmonies'' (2000) on Sunday. Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, www.bam.org; $10. (Dave Kehr) FILM COMMENT SELECTS (Tonight through Tuesday) There's still quite a lot to see in the final days of this lively series of new films and revivals programmed by the editors of Film Comment magazine. Screening this afternoon and Sunday evening is Robert Aldrich's red-hot political thriller of 1977, ''Twilight's Last Gleaming,'' in an uncut print from Mr. Aldrich's personal archives. Perhaps the most radical critique of America's Vietnam policy in the English-speaking cinema, it remains unavailable on domestic DVD. Tomorrow brings two recent films by the great landscape filmmaker James Benning, ''Ten Skies'' (10 10-minute shots of shifting skies) and ''13 Lakes'' (13 10-minute shots of lakes that reflect the landscape behind them). On Sunday and Monday, there's the United States premiere of ''These Encounters of Theirs,'' the final film collaboration by Jean-Marie Straub and Dani\u00e8le Huillet, and on Tuesday the series comes to an odd anticlimax with Paul Verhoeven's highly commercial World War II drama ''Black Book.'' Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5601, filmlinc.org; $10. (Kehr) PICTURES IN PRINT: LILLIAN ROSS AND THE MOVIES (Tonight through Wednesday) The New Yorker writer Lillian Ross has specialized in covering film-related subjects since the early '50s, when she profiled the director John Huston at work on ''The Red Badge of Courage'' in a series of articles that were later published as ''Picture.'' This tribute to Ms. Ross and her reportage begins tonight, appropriately, with a screening of ''Red Badge,'' introduced by Ms. Ross and followed by a discussion between her and Susan Morrison, an editor of The New Yorker. The program continues with Francis Ford Coppola's ''One from the Heart'' (tomorrow), Akira Kurosawa's ''Ran'' (Sunday), Otto Preminger's ''Anatomy of a Murder'' (Monday) and Richard Fleischer's ''Boston Strangler''(Wednesday). Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. APOLLO SUNSHINE (Wednesday and Thursday) The tunefulness of folk-rock and the Beatles goes joyously off the rails in the songs of this Boston band, which tends to get more raucously enthusiastic somewhere around the second verse. Wednesday at 8 p.m., with Maplewood, Inouk and Vampire Weekend, at the Annex, 152 Orchard Street, between Stanton and Rivington Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 673-3410, theannexnyc.com; $8.

(Jon Pareles) THE BIRD AND THE BEE (Monday) This Los Angeles duo toys with two fashionable ideas: retro French pop glittering with electronics, and ''Sex and the City''-style sexual conundrums, as the singer Inara George mulls the ways of noncommittal boyfriends and promises in a catwalk soprano -- to herself or a man, it's never clear -- ''I would be so winning, so absolutely winning.'' Monday at 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $15. (Ben Sisario) 'BROADWAY BY THE YEAR: THE MUSICALS OF 1928' (Monday) ''The Cradle Will Rock,'' ''Hellzapoppin,' '' ''The Boys From Syracuse'' and other shows from 1928 get the oh-what-a-time treatment in the latest installment of Town Hall's series, with Christiane Noll, Sarah Uriarte Berry, Hugh Panaro and Barbara Walsh. At 8 p.m., 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824, the-townhall-nyc.org; $40 to $50. (Sisario) * JUDY COLLINS (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday) What Ms. Collins brings to a song is perspective. You have the sense of a woman standing alone in the night air, gazing at a star and directing a beam of psychic energy into the cosmos. Or maybe she is the receiver of this cool, steady light; it cuts both ways. At 8:45 p.m., Caf\u00e9 Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $100 cover at tables, $65 at the bar. (Stephen Holden) DALEK (Tuesday) Dalek is a hip-hop trio from Newark led by a rapper of the same name, who intones apocalyptic rhymes over noisy, atmospheric backing tracks. With Destructo Swarmbots, Alex Delivery and Psychic Paramount. At 8 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10. (Sisario) Baby Jane Dexter (Tonight and tomorrow night) The theme of addiction, of someone being pursued by all sorts of demons, runs through the intelligent but disturbing show by this singer, whose pop-gospel voice projects strength, solidity and a heartiness that runs counter to the songs' images of people in thrall to fantasy. At 8, Metropolitan Room, 34 West 22nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 206-0440, metropolitanroom.com; $25 cover, two-drink minimum. (Holden) ROB DICKINSON (Wednesday) In the '90s Mr. Dickinson led the Catherine Wheel, a British band that created a muscular, dramatic sweep with fogs of guitar noise. He has since refashioned himself as a cynical balladeer in the Warren Zevon mode, the kind who may or may not be sarcastic when saying that the secret to life is merely ''to smile and hang out with intelligent people.'' At 7 p.m., Luna Lounge, 361 Metropolitan Avenue, at Havemeyer Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (866) 468-7619, lunalounge.com; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. (Sisario) THE DOUBLE (Tonight) Something is always intriguingly askew in the songs of this local band: jagged guitars, David Greenhill's neurotic sing-speak vocals, the asymmetric gurglings of its Vox Continental organ. But the oblique lines come together in unexpected and sometimes hauntingly beautiful ways. Tonight the band will preview songs from a new album. At 7:30 and 10, Monkey Town, 58 North Third Street, between Kent and Wythe Avenues, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 384-1369, monkeytownhq.com; $8, with a $10 minimum. (Sisario) J. J. GREY AND MOFRO (Thursday) A singer and guitarist from Jacksonville, Fla., who grows organic vegetables when not on the road, J. J. Grey uses a rich, funky swamp blues to mourn the erosion of rural values and celebrate life's most fundamental joys (''Glory, glory hallelujah/I'm alive and I'm feeling fine''). With Virginia Coalition. At 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $20. (Sisario) KILLSWITCH ENGAGE, DRAGONFORCE (Thursday) Killswitch Engage, from Massachusetts, churns those machine-gun metal guitars like the best of them, but also gets bravely mushy: ''I'll be waiting for the end of my broken heart,'' sings Howard Jones in a line that, were it not surrounded by biochemical noise, could have come from the wispiest emo boy. DragonForce, a six-man metal army from London, sounds like some combination of Iron Maiden and Yngwie Malmsteen on frantic fast-forward: all the chant-along major-key melodies and fretboard-tickling guitar solos of those '80s metal heroes are there, but sped up to an exhilarating (and comical) degree. With Chimaira and He Is Legend. At 6:45 p.m., Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, roselandballroom.com; $26 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sisario) * LINCOLN CENTER'S AMERICAN SONGBOOK (Tonight and tomorrow night) Having expanded greatly from its origins as a home for the midcentury pantheon of Harold Arlen, Richard Rodgers and the like, this series ends its ninth season with two young women whose programs exemplify its growth. Tonight is Neko Case, whose supple, powerful alto is just as eloquent in spunky indie-rock or the most somber country. Tomorrow the ever-classy Jane Monheit sings standards. Tonight at 8:30 and 10:30, and tomorrow night at 8:30, Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; sold out. (Sisario) JOHN MAYER (Wednesday) When recently crowned one of the 20 new guitar gods by Rolling Stone, this 29-year-old from Bridgeport, Conn., told the magazine, ''I want my guitar to sound like Sting's voice -- thick, on the bottom.'' He might have added elegant like Eric Clapton and nimbly funky like Curtis Mayfield. After some smooth if colorless hits early in his career, Mr. Mayer has pushed himself to develop his every musical muscle, and his latest album, ''Continuum'' (Columbia), is solid and deceptively easygoing, with worries about aging and the powerlessness of youth. At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 307-7171, thegarden.com; $45 and $55. (Sisario) * MY CHEMICAL ROMANCE (Tonight) The first emo band to embrace the bombast and drama of the rock opera, this New Jersey five-piece mingles fist-pumping stadium rock with sickly, Brechtian theatrics on its album ''The Black Parade'' (Reprise). It follows a tradition laid out by Green Day, Marilyn Manson and Pink Floyd, but does those bands one better by scoring a cameo from Liza Minnelli. With Rise Against. At 8, Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000, nassaucoliseum.com; $27.25.

(Sisario) * ELVIS PERKINS (Thursday) Having firmly established himself on the singer-songwriter circuit with a discursive acoustic style derived from groups like Clem Snide, Mr. Perkins has finally released his bittersweet and beautiful debut album, ''Ash Wednesday'' (XL). He began it in 2002, a decade after his father, the actor Anthony Perkins, died of AIDS, and a year after his mother, the fashion photographer Berry Berenson Perkins, perished on Sept. 11 in one of the planes that was crashed into the World Trade Center. At 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; sold out. (Sisario) EL PERRO DEL MAR (Thursday) The words ''be-bop-a-lula'' have never been sung with such plaintive fragility as when cooed by Sarah Assbring, a multitasking Swedish singer who records as El Perro del Mar. Her self-titled new album is a sweet and meticulous girl-group production for the Bjork age, with ''sha-la-la'' choruses echoing eerily as Ms. Assbring murmurs, ''This loneliness ain't pretty no more.'' She begins her first United States tour at the Bowery Ballroom, with Marissa Nadler and Chris Garneau opening the show. At 8 p.m., 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15 in advance, $18 at the door. (Sisario) IKE REILLY ASSASSINATION (Thursday) An eloquent wiseguy whose songs evoke Bob Dylan and Paul Westerberg, Mr. Reilly, a former bellhop and gravedigger from Chicago, has the kind of high-energy, hook-heavy folk-rock sound that turns every head in a bar, while his nasal vocals are unsparingly sardonic: ''The friends that you rely on are the train tracks that you lie on.'' At 9 p.m., Mo Pitkin's, 34 Avenue A, near Third Street, East Village, (212) 777-5660, mopitkins.com; $15. (Sisario) SOWETO GOSPEL CHOIR (Tonight) Gospel music and traditional South African harmonies and rhythms have found common ground and hybrid possibilities since Christian missionaries arrived in South Africa in the 19th century. This 26-member choir carries the fusion toward jubilation, performing traditional songs (and ''Mbube,'' the Zulu song better known as ''The Lion Sleeps Tonight''), alongside gospel messages. At 10, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; sold out. (Pareles) SPARKLEHORSE (Wednesday) Sunny, Beatlesesque melodies have to bubble through a melancholic film of entropy and electronic fuzz in the songs of Sparklehorse's Mark Linkous, a talented and troubled songwriter from Richmond, Va., whose languid fantasies have an endearing tendency to include horses, metaphorical and otherwise. With Jesse Sykes and the Sweet Hereafter. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $22. (Sisario) * Sandy Stewart and Bill Charlap (Tonight and tomorrow night) The style of this mother-son team is minimalist. Where conventional voice-and-piano duos follow a formula in which the music swells at dramatic moments, Ms. Stewart and Mr. Charlap use pauses, silences, and hushed moments to bring out the interior lives of songs. At 9 and 11:30, Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331, algonquinhotel.com; $60 cover; $65 dinner charge at 9; $25 minimum at 11:30.

As part of the Knitting Factory's strangely underhyped 20th-anniversary celebration (not to be confused with the Town Hall show that invokes the club's name), the Chicago band Trans Am, which plays tightly coiled, retro-futuristic electronic rock like a band stuck in the light matrix of ''Tron,'' plays two sets with Brooklyn's beloved Oneida, whose drums, keyboards and guitar converge into powerful, pulsating drones. At 6:45 and 10:30 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sisario) YOUNG LOVE (Wednesday) Dan Keyes, the skinny cherub who records as Young Love, is the latest indie rocker in the wake of the Killers to discover the dance floor. His debut, ''Too Young to Fight It'' (Island), enthusiastically follows a familiar if still fruitful formula: chunky guitar riffs plus kitschy synthesizers, high-adrenaline beats and lyrics like ''If you get the chance/You must dance, dance, dance.'' At 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $13. (Sisario) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. GERI ALLEN TRIO (Wednesday) ''Timeless Portraits and Dreams'' (Telarc) showcases Geri Allen's sleek pianism in a number of settings, including one with a vocal chorus. She revisits some of that material in a trio with her longtime associate Darryl Hall on bass and the venerable Jimmy Cobb on drums. At 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $44. (Nate Chinen) BROOKLYN QAWWALI PARTY (Tomorrow) The Sufi devotional music of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan provides a repertory mandate for this ensemble. Faithful to its source mainly in terms of exuberance, the group creates a storm of percussion, horns, harmonium and guitars.

(Chinen) TAYLOR HO BYNUM AND TOMAS FUJIWARA (Tuesday) On ''True Events'' (482 Music), a scintillating album due out next week, Mr. Bynum, a cornetist, and Mr. Fujiwara, a drummer, engage in a duologue crackling with improvisational energy but guided by compositional prescription. At 8 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen) * FRANK CARLBERG (Tonight) Mr. Carlberg is a pianist and composer enamored of language, as he demonstrates on his most recent album, ''State of the Union'' (Fresh Sound New Talent).

(Chinen) THE FOUR BAGS (Sunday) The instrumental palette of the Four Bags -- Brian Drye on trombone, Jacob Garchik on accordion, Sean Moran on guitar and Mike McGinnis on reeds -- suggests a contemporary species of chamber jazz.

Opera * 'EUGENE ONEGIN' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) The dynamic conductor Valery Gergiev and the baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky bring stylistic authority to the Metropolitan Opera's revival of its 1997 production of Tchaikovsky's ''Eugene Onegin.'' Mr. Hvorostovsky is riveting in the title role, singing with earthy richness and fully conveying this worldly, entitled and dashing young man's aloofness. The surprises come from the soprano Ren\u00e9e Fleming, in her first Russian role at the Met, who gives a vocally exquisite and vulnerable portrayal of Tatiana, and the tenor Ram\u00f3n Vargas, a bel canto specialist, who makes an ardent and endearing Lenski. You will seldom see better acting in opera. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anthony Tommasini) 'IPHIG\u00c9NIE EN AULIDE' (Tonight) The opera productions at the Juilliard School have generally been thoughtfully staged and vocally polished. The school is also judicious in its repertory choices. ''Iphig\u00e9nie en Aulide'' has much to recommend it, as Gluck's dramatically focused and supremely lyrical operas invariably do. The cast for Robin Guarino's production includes Tharanga Goonetilleke in the title role, with Paul LaRosa as Agamemnon, Faith Sherman as Clytemnestra and Paul Appleby as Achille, with Ari Pelto conducting. At 8, Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Juilliard School, 155 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406, juilliard.edu; free.

(Bernard Holland) 'SIMON BOCCANEGRA' (Tonight and Tuesday night) A strong cast led by Angela Gheorghiu, Thomas Hampson, Ferruccio Furlanetti and Marcello Giordani and conducted by a fairly volcanic conductor named Fabio Luisi continues the Met's run of this dark, convoluted and often beautiful opera. At 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $110 to $295 tickets remaining tonight; $15 to $275 on Tuesday. (Holland) 'TH\u00c9R\u00c8SE RAQUIN' (Tonight through Sunday) Six years after its premiere, this work by Tobias Picker is finally having its first New York performances, by the Dicapo Opera, in a reduced version for chamber orchestra. But opera tends to romanticize its subjects, and Mr. Picker's librettist, Gene Scheer, certainly does, turning the stultifying bourgeois characters that surround Th\u00e9r\u00e8se into heart-of-gold stereotypes. Still, the vocal writing is grateful, and the story is reasonably compelling: the best moment is the reappearance of Camille, the murdered husband, as a ghost. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 4 p.m., Dicapo Opera Theater, 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-9438, dicapo.com; $47.50. (Anne Midgette) 'DIE ZAUBERFL\u00d6TE' (Tomorrow) The revival of Julie Taymor's production of Mozart's ''Zauberfl\u00f6te'' continues at the Met, complete with the magical puppets and stage effects that made it an audience hit when it opened in 2004. James Levine conducts a cast that includes Lisa Milne as Pamina, Cornelia G\u00f6tz as Queen of the Night, Michael Schade as Pamino, Rodion Pogossov as Papageno, Eike Wilm Schulte as the Speaker, and Vitalij Kowaljow as Sarastro.

(Holland) CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Tonight and Sunday) This admirable mini-festival called ''An English Musical Renaissance'' intensely focuses on an area of music that's only passingly familiar to most concertgoers: the first decades of the 20th century, when English composers were striving to find a distinctive voice. The series closes this weekend with a concert tonight featuring songs performed by Susanne Mentzer and works by Benjamin Dale, Frederick Delius and Frank Bridge and, on Sunday, with William Walton's early Piano Quartet in D minor and a riper Piano Quintet by the mature Edward Elgar.

Spain and mezzo-sopranos seem to have a particular affinity.

At 7:30 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $34. (Midgette) JUILLIARD STRING QUARTET (Thursday) The Juilliard Quartet is celebrating its 60th anniversary with an all-Mozart program. The group has another excuse to celebrate: the Juilliard School's recent acquisition of Mozart manuscripts. The program includes the Quartets in E flat (K. 428), D minor (K. 421) and C (K. 465). At 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406, juilliard.edu; free, but tickets are required.

(Kozinn) JAIME LAREDO, LEON FLEISHER (Thursday) Schubert wrote meltingly for the violin, and melodiously for just about any instrument, talents demonstrated in four of his Sonatas for Violin and Piano from 1816 and 1817. In a recital devoted to the works, the singing violin lines, taken by Jaime Laredo, will be balanced out by the masterly pianist Leon Fleisher. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $40 to $54. (Midgette) NEW WORLD SYMPHONY (Tuesday and Wednesday) Michael Tilson Thomas has done wonders with this Florida-based national youth orchestra, and he will show off its strengths (ideally) with an all-Shostakovich program that includes the Cello Concerto No. 2, with Yo-Yo Ma as the soloist. In a ''Discovery'' program on Wednesday, Mr. Thomas offers insights into Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony, which the orchestra performs again. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $40 to $129 on Tuesday; $10 to $35 on Wednesday.

(Holland) PEOPLE'S COMMISSIONING FUND CONCERT/BANG ON A CAN ALL-STARS (Thursday) However democratic the process of commissioning music, the idea of doing so with a fund gathered from donations of as little as $5 is appealing, and Bang on a Can's annual concert can be counted on to generate electricity and excitement. The main focus this year may not be the three hot young composers Lukas Ligeti, Joshua Penman and Stefan Weisman, but a hot established one, Meredith Monk, who will be a guest and join in performances of five works of her own. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, kaufman-center.org; $20 in advance; $25 at the door. (Midgette) PHILADELPHIA ORCHESTRA (Thursday) The charismatic pianist Martha Argerich is soloist in Beethoven's Second Piano Concerto.

Kimper and Gilda Lyons for the latest installment in a five-year collaboration. Musical texts include poetry by Paul Bowles and a setting in Hebrew of the 23rd Psalm. Sharing the program are Alexandra Shilling and Ann Robideaux, who create a surreal landscape in their new ''Long Night.'' (Through March 3.) Thursday at 8 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, TriBeCa, (212) 279-4200 and dnadance.org; $17. (Dunning) Anna Sperber (Thursday through Saturday) In her first full-length show at Dance Theater Workshop, Ms. Sperber investigates the space between resistance and release, as an all-female cast navigates a walled-in landscape in ''The Tiger Situation.'' At 7:30 p.m., 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, dtw.org; $12 and $20. (La Rocco) TRINITY IRISH DANCE COMPANY (Tonight and Sunday) This large Irish-American company, which performs in two theaters in the New York region this weekend, is known for its ''progressive'' (read newfangled) Irish dancing to accompaniment on guitar, uilleann pipes and drums. Tonight at 8, Tilles Center, C. W. Post Campus, Route 25A, Brookville, N.Y., (516) 299-3100, tillescenter.org; $40 to $65; $37 to $62 for 65+.

Sunday and Monday at 7:30 p.m., Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3587, worksandprocess.org; $24; $20 for 65+; $15 for students. (Dunning) Chantal Yzermans/Radical Low (Thursday through Saturday) Catch the United States premiere of the Belgian choreographer Chantal Yzermans's newest work, ''ONR-I, allegory of night.'' Created by Ms. Yzermans in 2002, Radical Low employs custom software created by the artists to probe the places where dance and technology meet. In ''ONR-I,'' this exploration is in the service of mythology, some of it as ancient as the technology is new. At 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194; $15. (La Rocco) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * American Folk Art Museum: MART\u00edN RAM\u00edREZ, through April 29. Ram\u00edrez, a Mexican peasant who immigrated to Northern California and died there at 68 in 1963, spent the last 32 years of his life in a mental hospital, making some of the greatest art of the last century. He had his own way with materials and color and an unforgettable cast of characters (most notably, a mounted caballero and a levitating Madonna crowned like the Statue of Liberty.) But most of all, Ram\u00edrez had his own brand of pictorial space, established by rhythmic systems of parallel lines, both curved and straight, whose mesmerizing expansions and contractions simultaneously cosset and isolate his figures. This show should render null and void the distinction between insider and outsider art. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * American Museum of Natural History: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples -- larded with fascinating facts and tales -- ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Smith) * Asia Society: Glass, Gilding, and Grand Design: Art of Sasanian Iran (224-642 A.D.), through May 20. This glinting, glowing show is a reduction of a much larger Paris exhibition that included material from Iranian museums impossible to bring to the United States. But with some 70 examples of silver, glass and silk textile fragments, many from European museums, it is still substantial and the first major exhibition of its kind in this part of the world for more than 30 years. For about four centuries, the Sasanians ruled territory stretching from present-day Iran and Iraq to North Africa. Their only rivals were Rome, Byzantium and, at the very end, the early Islamic dynasties. Much of their surviving art is a sterling example of empire in action. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400. (Holland Cotter) * Grey Art Gallery: 'Semina Culture: Wallace Berman & His Circle,' through March 31. The artist Wallace Berman (1926-76) may ring only a faint bell to many New Yorkers, but he was a central, charismatic figure in an underground of West Coast artists and poets in the 1950s and 60s. A collagist, poet, photographer and the publisher of an influential journal, Semina, he inspired others to make art too, sparking hidden aptitude in startling places. After meeting him, drifters, movie stars, ex-marines and petty criminals found themselves starting to paint and write. And a traveling love company of them has come to Grey Art Gallery, trailing dreams, delusions and marijuana clouds. New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780. (Cotter) Guggenheim Museum: 'Family Pictures,' through April 16. This show sounds ripe with possibilities. The results, however, are more mixed. The exhibition is drawn from the museum's collection, which explains some of its exclusions and limitations. Many artists you associate with contemporary photography and the family are not in attendance: Richard Bellingham, Tina Barney, Malerie Marder. There is also a sense of false advertising in the exhibition's title. The museum's news release extends the exhibition's exploration into ''representation of families and children in contemporary art and video.'' Images of children, you quickly realize, can operate as a completely different genre. A good portion of the work falls under this rubric. Rineke Dijkstra's ''Beach Portraits'' of adolescents posing awkwardly against stark seascape horizons are isolated (and isolating) images of children on the threshold of adulthood. You don't think about family when gazing at these photographs. Sally Mann is perhaps the best-known contemporary photographer of children, specifically her own. Ms. Mann, represented here by black-and-white photographs from the late 1980s and early 1990s of her ethereally gorgeous children (now grown), has been accused of everything from neglect to child abuse. The questions raised by her dual role as artist and mother, simultaneous protector and potential exploiter of the family, and her choice of family as the central focus of artistic practice, remain vitally interesting. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Martha Schwendener) International Center of Photography: 'Henri Cartier-Bresson's Scrapbook: Photographs, 1932-46,' through April 29. Arrived by way of the Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson in Paris, this show has more than 300 of the prints the photographer glued into an album and toted to New York for curators at the Museum of Modern Art to cull. Captured by the Nazis, he had been presumed dead when the Modern planned his retrospective. Then he turned up alive -- the ''posthumous'' exhibition opened, with him in attendance, in 1947. The current exhibition reconstructs as best as possible the original layout of the scrapbook. It's an eye-straining affair, but it surveys the revolutionary work he shot in Spain, Italy, Mexico, Britain and France. His taste for uncanny detail linked him to Surrealism and Surrealist wit, but unlike many Surrealists, he remained committed to human values. Boys mug at his camera. Prostitutes swan. Their gazes equalize them with us. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Michael Kimmelman) International Center of Photography: 'Martin Munkacsi: Think While You Shoot!' through April 29. Munkacsi, who inspired Cartier-Bresson, was, by contrast, self-taught, a creature of his own devising. This is the most complete retrospective, with a thick catalog (not too well researched) and dozens of vintage prints from the 1920s through the early '60s. He favored scenes of daily life, absorbing avant-garde ideas about odd angles and abstract compositions. In 1928 he moved to Berlin and traveled the world on assignment to Brazil, Algeria and Egypt. Munkacsi was a stylist, and he made catchy images the only way he knew how, in a modernist mode, which, being an opportunistic form, could serve any master. (See above.) (Kimmelman) * The METropOlitan museum of art: 'ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,' through Sept. 3. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92), portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht Durer, and Bonnie Seeman's fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck) * Morgan Library & Museum: 'Private Treasures: Four Centuries of European Master Drawings,' through April 8. This show is drawn entirely from an anonymous private collection. Despite the veil of secrecy, a couple of things are obvious: the collector had significant capital for investing in old masters and either an exceptional eye or a good adviser (or both). The works span more than 400 years, from the 16th to the early 20th century, and include drawings in ink and pencil, watercolor, chalk and gouache. The earliest works come from a period when drawing wasn't an autonomous practice but was used as a form of exercise, to apply one's craft, to experiment and to make preliminary sketches for larger works. The best example -- and the most historically significant work here -- is a black chalk drawing, ''The Dead Christ'' (1529-35), by Agnolo Bronzino. With more than 90 drawings in the show, being a diligent observer quickly becomes exhausting. In which case, put down the guide, find a few drawings you like, and enjoy them while you can. After all, you don't know where they came from, where they're going, or when you'll see them again. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Schwendener) Museum of Modern Art: 'Artistic Collaborations: 50 Years of Universal Limited Art Editions,' through May 21. This exhibition marks the half-century milestone for Universal Limited Art Editions in West Islip, N.Y., and its association with the Museum of Modern Art: The museum has acquired one print from every edition made at Universal, more than 1,200 works by nearly 50 artists. Prints by 12 artists are in this show. Among them are lithographs by Jasper Johns, mostly from the 1960s, with his signature maps and flags. Robert Rauschenberg is represented primarily by lithographs from the 1960s that combine found images of figures like John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson with the freehand scrawling associated with Abstract Expressionism. It's hard to fault an exhibition that features prints by masters like Mr. Johns and Mr. Rauschenberg. But given the somewhat precarious position of prints in the contemporary art world, the inclusion of younger artists would make a good argument that traditional printmaking is still relevant and holds possibilities for this generation. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Schwendener) * MOMA: Armando Rever\u00d3n, through April 16. Unless you spotted his single smoke-puff of a painting at MoMA months ago, Armando Rever\u00f3n probably means nothing to you. Why should he? The artist, who died in 1954, spent most of his life in a shack by the sea in his native Venezuela. Many of his contemporaries dismissed him as nuts. His white-on-white pictures are practically unphotographable. But chances are that if you visit this retrospective, you'll find yourself thinking about him a lot. His art and his story are like few others, and so is the museum's inspired installation: a single, long corridor with cabinetlike rooms of paintings on either side and, at the very end, against a sea-green wall, a life-size doll with giant bat wings floating overhead. (See above.) (Cotter) * National Academy Museum: HIGH TIMES, HARD TIMES: NEW YORK PAINTING, 1967-1975, through April 22. Organized under the auspices of International Curators Incorporated, this brave if confused exhibition is the first to tackle a neglected subject: New York painting during the period it was supposed to be dead. The show's 42 works by 37 artists reveal that, far from dead, painting was in fact in an uproar that was commensurate with the artistic, social and political turbulence of the times. The alternation between artists who remained loyal in their way to stretched canvas and those who abandoned it, which makes for clear installation, also tidies up history. The main problem is that the exhibition sticks too purposefully to the margins, mixing generations and levels of achievement and continuing the neglect of the main story. Too much of this work is as derivative now as it was then, and functions more as artifact than art. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Smith) Neuberger Museum of Art: FUGITIVE ARTIST: THE EARLY WORK OF RICHARD PRINCE, 1974-77, through June 24. This artist is one of the most elusive, perverse and sardonic of all of the important appropriation artists to emerge in the early 1980s, so perhaps it is not surprising that he has boycotted this exhibition of little-known early work, all from public and private collections. But that doesn't stop the 50 pieces on view from revealing his roots in 1970s Conceptual Art; his progress from generic to original and radical; or the depth and duration of his fascination with language, photography, print-making, the more banal forms of urban postwar Americana and a disconnected, decidedly male blankness. If anything, it increases his stature. Purchase College, State University of New York, 735 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, N.Y., (914) 251-6100, neuberger.org. (Smith) Galleries: Chelsea * Fredericks & Freiser: BAKER OVERSTREET: NEW PAINTINGS, through March 17. Like Keegan McHargue and Devendra Banhart, this young artist has a penchant for tribal motifs, which he flattens into symmetrical compositions and renders with an outsider roughness. The works in his debut show evoke the imagery of the space-ship-obsessed, self-taught artist Ionel Talpazan, as well as Alfred Jensen and Forrest Bess. Their notion of the visionary is both self conscious and familiar, but they are painted with energetic dispatch and a sure sense of scale, color and wit that encourages you to stay tuned. 536 West 24th Street, (212) 633-6555. (Smith) Last Chance * Ceres: Agents of Change: Women, Art, and Intellect In a gathering wave of feminist shows this season, this one is a modest-size, timely arrival. Organized by the artist Leslie King-Hammond, with an immaculate installation by Lowery Stokes Sims, it's a multiethnic, multi-generational pick of work by 19 artists spanning some 40 years. If there's a theme, it's a loose one: feminist art happened, in many forms; it is still happening, in many forms. 547 West 27th Street, Suite 201, Chelsea, (212) 947-6100; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) Chambers Fine Art: QIU ZHIJIE: THE SHAPE OF TIME Chinese calligraphy and landscape painting are rendered postmodern in 24 large color photographs that document the performance-writing (at night, with a flashlight, before a time-lapse camera) of characters for the solar markers of the Chinese year. The haunting results resemble elegant, disembodied neon and are suspended (along with blurred hints of the artist himself) in settings where old China meets new. 210 Eleventh Avenue, at 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-1169; closes tomorrow. (Smith) China Institute: 'Shu: Reinventing Books in Contemporary Chinese' This second installation of a two-part show glances back at the period of artistic expansion in the 1970s, and its contraction, when the Communist Party clamped down on free expression after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Qiu Zhijie's photographic ''library,'' which papers the walls of the China Institute's main staircase, makes evident the information explosion in the '80s. Among the thousands of titles are Chinese classics, books on natural sciences, and treatises by Plato, Disraeli and Harold Bloom, as well as art books on Indian stupa, Japanese manga and Barbara Kruger. Such a trove might have been considered a treasure before Tiananmen Square; afterward, such resources became sources of angst. The figure that appears throughout Zhang Xiaogang's 1991 series ''Private Notes,'' for example, looks as if he is losing his mind as he struggles to write letters and decode illegible manuscripts. Without easy access to words, the images imply, there can be no such thing as free expression. 125 East 65th Street, (212) 744-8181, chinainstitute.org; closes tomorrow. (Bridget L. Goodbody) * Danziger Projects: Seydou Keita and Lolo Veleko The great Malian photographer Seydou Keita, who died in 2001, gave us modern Bamako in his black-and-white studio portraits. The young South African photographer Lolo Veleko, a star of ''Snap Judgments'' at the International Center of Photography last year, gives us contemporary Johannesburg, in fabulous color, in hers. 521 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 629-6778; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) Momenta Art: ELISABETH KLEY A fascination with drag stars like the filmmaker Jack Smith and the Warhol regular Candy Darling and, it would seem, their relationship to the exotic and to non-Western decorative traditions fuels this dense show of collaged ink drawings and sly majolica ceramic vessels. Preening peacocks are another point of departure, and the plethora of eyes, whether in the portraits, the tail feathers or the glazes, creates a watchful intensity that turns the traditional straight, Western gaze back on itself. 359 Bedford Avenue, near South Fourth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 218-8058; through Monday. (Smith) * NEUE GALLERY: 'JOSEF HOFFMANN: INTERIORS, 1902-1913' Hoffmann was a believer in the Gesamkunstwerk, or ''total work of art,'' orchestrating useful objects with paintings, sculptures and architecture in a composition greater than its parts. His early, intensely 20th-century design program, based on the grid and the square, is evident here in the installation of four interiors he designed for wealthy Viennese patrons, replete with furniture, wall and floor coverings, textiles, lighting, ceramics, glass and metal work. Most impressive here is the dining room he designed in 1913 for the Geneva apartment of the Swiss Symbolist painter Ferdinand Hodler, a large, calm space with furniture that has a pre-postmodern look. Behind the dining room is a huge vitrine fitted out with a dazzling variety of Hoffmann-designed useful and decorative objects; other showcases display larger works. Though focused on interiors, the show conveys the basic ideas of a designer immersed in a new vision. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org; closes on Monday. (Glueck) Storefront for Art and Architecture: 'Clip/Stamp/Fold' This show examines the world of small magazines from the early 1960s to the end of the 1970s, when the field of architecture was still marked by a playful intellectual and political independence. It's packed with gorgeous cover images, from copulating robots to an elephant attacking the Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan to a skyscraper made of Swiss cheese. Often thrown together on a shoestring budget, the magazines have an intoxicating freshness that should send a shudder down the spine of those who've spent the last decade bathed in the glow of the computer screen. But this is not an exercise in nostalgia. It's a piercing critique, intended or not, of the smoothness of our contemporary design culture. These magazine covers map out an era when architecture was simmering with new ideas. You're bound to leave the show with a nagging sense of what was lost as well as gained during the electronic juggernaut of the last three decades. 97 Kenmare Street, between Mulberry and Lafayette Streets, Little Italy, (212) 431-5795, storefrontnews.org; closes tomorrow.
