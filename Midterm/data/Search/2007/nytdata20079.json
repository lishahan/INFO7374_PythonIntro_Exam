Although Fox strategically broadcast the finale after the ''American Idol'' results show, which dominated the 8 o'clock hour with 24.2 million viewers, ''The O.'' faced tremendous competition at 9 from CBS's ''CSI'' (21.6 million) and ABC's ''Grey's Anatomy,'' which earned a season-high 27.3 million viewers in the hour. At 10, opposite ABC's ''Oprah Winfrey Oscar Special'' (15.8 million), and CBS's ''Shark'' (14.3 million), NBC's ''ER'' drew 9.9 million total viewers and posted its lowest ratings among adults 18 to 49 in its 12-and-a-half-year history. NBC finished a distant fourth for the night. Fox ranked second in the 18-to-49 demographic but third in total viewers behind CBS. ABC was first over all.
