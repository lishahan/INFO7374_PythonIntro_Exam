The Grammys try to notice every niche of popular music and, with 108 categories this year, they can't keep up. But they do delve well beyond the Top 10 and the familiar names on the television show. I'm not picking winners here. The Grammys are inscrutable, especially in categories with only a coterie of voters, but these nominated albums and songs deserve their instant of Grammy attention. Dafnis Prieto The best Latin jazz album category holds more musical brainpower attached to more twisted melodies and more kinetic rhythms than any other Grammy niche. Lately Latin musicians have revitalized some of the knottiest structures of 1960s jazz, then gone on to make them dance, and all five entries in this category -- including those by Edsel Gomez, Ignacio Berroa, the Brian Lynch/Eddie Palmieri Project and Diego Urcola -- are worth hearing. The most brilliantly convoluted of the nominees is ''Absolute Quintet'' (Zoho) by the Cuban drummer Dafnis Prieto. His playing flaunts every shift built into his compositions and infuses every unexpected turn with a sense of joyful discovery. Casey Driessen Acoustic pickers and fiddlers have taken over the best country instrumental performance category, which includes Casey Driessen's ''Jerusalem Ridge,'' a thoroughly unorthodox remake of a fiddle tune from Bill Monroe. It's on Mr. Driessen's album ''3D'' (Sugar Hill). Over a choppy strummed beat that's almost funky, multiple fiddles come and go -- grappling with one another, sharing the tune as a chorale, switching its beat, even briefly carrying it eastward. It's a tour de force that still holds on to the tune's Celtic roots. Sex Mob The best contemporary jazz album category is usually good for tepid pop-jazz, but not this year. Sex Mob's ''Sexotica'' (Thirsty Ear) is the avant-gutbucket New York City brass-and-saxophone band's tribute to Martin Denny, a purveyor of lounge-music exotica in the 1950s and 1960s. The concept gives Sex Mob, led by Steven Bernstein on slide trumpet, excuses to toy with an international assortment of percussion and Mr. Denny's slinky modal tunes. It's sly and boisterous music, poised between parody and skeptical appreciation. The remixers Good and Evil sometimes toss in samples or chop up the music just to add an extra level of disorientation. Tye Tribbett In a year of increasingly grim wartime news, gospel insists on hope. Perhaps it's no accident that two nominees for best gospel performance are songs called ''Victory'': one by Tye Tribbett and one by Yolanda Adams. Ms. Adams sings with a soul belter's intensity about overcoming material hardships in her ''Victory'' (Verity). But Mr. Tribbett promises even greater empowerment to believers. Backed by an choir, razzle-dazzle horns and a funk rhythm section worthy of Prince on ''Victory Live!'' (Columbia), he bounces exhortations and percussive screams off his choir's enthusiastic responses, promising, ''Every situation I face I win/And everything works for my good in the end.'' The Flaming Lips Best rock instrumental is where straight-faced old-school lead guitarists -- Peter Frampton, Joe Satriani, David Gilmour -- run into alt-rockers like Arctic Monkeys and the Flaming Lips, whose ''The Wizard Turns On '' (from the Warner Brothers album ''At War With the Mystics'') is the goofiest nominated track. After a full 45 seconds of feedback and distortion, the song coalesces, more or less, into a woozy psychedelic march, smudging its own pomp with stray electronic noises and outlandishly wah-wahed guitar before melting down again. Alongside it the guitar heroes sound corny. Oscar D'Le\u00f3n The Venezuelan singer, bandleader and bass player Oscar D'Le\u00f3n has been a champion of classic salsa, but ''Fuzionando'' (Norte/Sony BMG), nominated for best tropical Latin album, announces its intentions in its title: it fuses salsa with reggaet\u00f3n, flamenco and rock. The ambitions are pan-Latin, with some social commentary on black pride amid songs about love and dancing, echoing the 1970s legacy of pan-American thinkers like Rub\u00e9n Blades. The music is buoyant and affable, perhaps because Mr. D'Le\u00f3n knows he can outsing any of his guests. Northern Cree and Friends Drums pound steadily and voices whoop and shriek on ''Long Winter Nights: Round Dance Live'' (Canyon) by Northern Cree and Friends, a nominee for best Native American music album. It's stark traditionalist music with a primal, frenzied edge from singers who shout, wail, ululate and hoot bird cries. And when English lyrics arrive, some of them turn out to be deeply infuriated breakup songs. Buick Project Dance-music remixers are simultaneously restrictive and extravagant. They quantize vocals to fit a metronomic dance beat, but also freely reimagine songs after they've been reduced to their barest remnants. Nominated for best remixed recording, nonclassical, Buick Project's remix of ''Damage'' (Fine/Four Music Productions) by the German production team Tiefschwarz, featuring Tracey Thorn, makes a lonely song even lonelier. The remix keeps the synthetic bassline but turns the original's crisp chords into murky clouds; it puts space between electro blips, so they sound more like heart-monitor alerts or pacemaker jolts; and it leaves Ms. Thorn sounding more stranded than ever as she sings, ''I was always there, but you never chose to care.'' Hossein Alizadeh and Djivan Gasparyan The tone is mournful, the pace is measured and the atmosphere is profound on ''Endless Vision'' (World Village). It is nominated for best traditional world music album, but it crosses some traditional boundaries. Hossein Alizadeh, from Iran, is a virtuoso on Persian lutes who plays, on this album, the six-stringed shurangiz. Djivan Gasparyan is Armenian and plays the duduk, a liquid-toned reed flute. They recorded this live in Tehran, Iran, with a group that included male and female vocalists -- a rare mixed-gender ensemble -- singing recent and ancient poetry with a somber concentration that almost suspends time.", "abstract": "Jon Pareles reviews nine Grammy-nominated albums; photos (M)", "print_page": "32", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Under the Radar but Well Worth Their Grammy Invitations", "kicker": "MUSIC: PLAYLIST"}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "MUSIC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "GRAMMY AWARDS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECORDINGS AND DOWNLOADS (AUDIO)"}], "pub_date": "2007-02-11T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Arts and Leisure Desk", "section_name": "Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Jon", "lastname": "Pareles"}], "original": "By Jon Pareles"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd255c78eb7c8105d7fee18", "word_count": 973, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E5DD103FF932A25751C0A9619C8B63", "snippet": "The BRITISH ACADEMY FILM AWARDS, often considered a predictor of the Oscars, will be presented in London on Sunday night.

The nominees for best film are a fairly familiar slate: ''Babel,'' ''The Departed,'' ''The Last King of Scotland'' and ''The Queen,'' though the best-actor nominees have a vaguely Anglophilic slant: Daniel Craig for ''Casino Royale,'' Richard Griffiths for ''The History Boys,'' Peter O'Toole for ''Venus,'' as well as the inveterate (but heavily accented) Americans Leonardo DiCaprio for ''Blood Diamond'' and Forest Whitaker for ''The Last King of Scotland.'' Are the bookies even taking bets on Helen Mirren for ''The Queen''? Other film honors on Sunday night include the Annie Awards (for animated films), the Visual Effects Society Awards and the Writers Guild of America Awards. Meanwhile the invaluable cable channel Turner Classic Movies continues its monthlong festival of Oscar winners and nominees. For cinephiles, Saturday's selection of best-score nominees offers the richest selection of rarely seen titles, including Bernard Vorhaus's 1939 ''WAY DOWN SOUTH'' (with music by Victor Young but, more important perhaps, a screenplay by Langston Hughes and Clarence Muse); John Brahm's 1938 study in female pugilism, ''Girls' School'' (score by Morris Stoloff and Gregory Stone); and Joseph L. Mankiewicz's final film, the 1972 ''Sleuth,'' with Laurence Olivier, Michael Caine and the music of John Addison. And a final TiVo tip: The Fox Movie Channel will be running Raoul Walsh's 1930 western ''THE BIG TRAIL'' in its rare wide-screen version on Tuesday. Filmed in the 70-millimeter Grandeur process -- a predecessor of the format Fox would revive in the 1950s as CinemaScope -- the film features a young, inexperienced John Wayne in the foreground and some of the most formally inventive wide-screen filmmaking ever conceived in the deeper-than-deep-focus backgrounds. Because Fox, bizarrely, chose to put only the conventionally filmed 1.33 version on its DVD release of this important title, these rare television screenings are just about the only way to see the film as Walsh intended it (though he did have something larger than a 32-inch screen in mind).", "abstract": null, "print_page": "4", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "THE WEEK AHEAD: Feb. 11 - 17; FILM"}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2007-02-11T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Arts and Leisure Desk", "section_name": "Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Dave", "lastname": "Kehr"}], "original": "By Dave Kehr"}, "type_of_material": "Schedule", "_id": "4fd2b0358eb7c8105d89f7ba", "word_count": 340, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/11/movies/11olse.html", "snippet": "Creating the sound for Craig Brewer\u2019s latest film, \u201cBlack Snake Moan,\u201d meant mining the blues....", "lead_paragraph": "Creating the sound for Craig Brewer\u2019s latest film, \u201cBlack Snake Moan,\u201d meant mining the blues.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "6", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [{"width": 75, "url": "images/2007/02/11/arts/11olse.75.jpg", "height": 75, "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"thumbnailheight": "75", "thumbnail": "images/2007/02/11/arts/11olse.75.jpg", "thumbnailwidth": "75"}, "type": "image"}], "headline": {"main": "Back to Memphis, This Time Making the City Moan", "content_kicker": "Film", "print_headline": "Back to Memphis, This Time Making The City Moan"}, "keywords": [{"rank": "1", "is_major": "N", "name": "subject", "value": "Motion Pictures"}, {"rank": "2", "is_major": "N", "name": "persons", "value": "Brewer, Craig"}, {"rank": "3", "is_major": "N", "name": "persons", "value": "Jackson, Samuel L"}, {"rank": "4", "is_major": "N", "name": "persons", "value": "Ricci, Christina"}, {"rank": "5", "is_major": "N", "name": "glocations", "value": "Memphis (Tenn)"}], "pub_date": "2007-02-11T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Arts&Leisure", "section_name": "Movies", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Mark", "rank": 1, "lastname": "OLSEN"}], "original": "By MARK OLSEN"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "548ea66238f0d8437a5dc495", "word_count": "1041", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/11/fashion/shows/11nunez.html", "snippet": "Johnny Nu\u00f1ez uses his charm to gain valuable access in the world of hip-hip....", "lead_paragraph": "Johnny Nu\u00f1ez uses his charm to gain valuable access in the world of hip-hip.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [{"width": 600, "url": "images/2007/02/09/fashion/11nune.1.600.jpg", "height": 350, "subtype": "xlarge", "legacy": {"xlargewidth": "600", "xlarge": "images/2007/02/09/fashion/11nune.1.600.jpg", "xlargeheight": "350"}, "type": "image"}, {"width": 75, "url": "images/2007/02/09/fashion/11nune.1.75.jpg", "height": 75, "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"thumbnailheight": "75", "thumbnail": "images/2007/02/09/fashion/11nune.1.75.jpg", "thumbnailwidth": "75"}, "type": "image"}], "headline": {"main": "A Paparazzo?
