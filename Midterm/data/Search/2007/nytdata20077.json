As befits a hairstyle honoring Brill, a woman who famously takes six hours to dress, it's quite a job to make, but the results -- 1940s glamour and '80s edge -- are tr\u00e8s chic: just work a handful of K\u00e9rastase Mousse Nutri-Sculpt throughout the hair and blow-dry. Then use a 1 1/2-inch barreled curling iron to create voluptuous curls from root to tip. With a big paddle brush (Sephora has a good one), sweep the sides up into a chignon, leaving the top loose, and secure with heavy-duty bobby pins. Murenu uses a touch of serum (try John Frieda Frizz-Ease) at the sides. For a hard, punky finish, use a little gel (like Oscar Blandi Acqua Marina) to artfully muss your curls.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "156", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times",

The gold-plated Hoscar, depicting a toned traveler holding a plaque, awards greatness in hostelry. This year's Hoscar ceremony, sponsored by www.hostelworld.com, recently took place in Dublin. Some 500,000 online voters named the Jetpak City Hostel in Berlin ''Best Hostel of 2006.'' Runners-up included the Hostel of the Sun in Naples, Italy, and La Chimba in Santiago, Chile. In another online competition, the 2006 TripAdvisor Travelers' Choice Awards, it was the Hilton Maldives Resort and Spa Rangali Island that took top honors in the category of ''Best Luxury Hotel in the World.'' Perhaps it was Ithaa, the world's first undersea restaurant, below, that helped the resort clinch the title. From July 15 to 28, Sierra Club Outings will sponsor the first public trip through Cordillera Azul National Park in central Peru, which was created by the government in 2001 after 28 never-before-seen species of plants and animals were discovered in a remote area between the Huallaga and Ucayali rivers. The cost for the trip, which includes canoeing, backpacking and helicopter transfers to and from the park, is $3,395. The second trip is planned for Oct. 1 to 14 (sierraclub.org/outings/national). EasyHotel, a budget hotel chain, is scheduled to open a property in Luton, England -- about three miles from the London Luton Airport -- by the end of the year. Prices will start at around 25 pounds, or $49.75 at $1.99 to the pound, and reservations will be available on www.easyHotel.com later this year. Through May 6, Budget Rent A Car customers who reserve a car for four or more consecutive days that include a Sunday will receive the Sunday rental for free (www.budget.com/freesunday; coupon number TUNZ001 must be mentioned).
