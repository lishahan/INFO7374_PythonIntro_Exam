But young fans don't have to worry that their favorite haunt has become melancholy; it's also singing the reds, the yellows and every other shade that the primary hues create. ''Elmo's Coloring Book,'' a production of Sesame Street Live, celebrates the entire spectrum with music, movement, humor and spectacle. The 90-minute show, in revival at the Theater at Madison Square Garden, stars Professor Art, a pleasant variation on a mad inventor. His singing and dancing sidekicks are the Palettes (the accent is on the second syllable), a trio of furry monsters who are supposed to be like the Rockettes, except they obviously don't shave their legs. Professor Art has created the Guzzinta 2000, a machine that takes the characters inside the coloring book of that little red monster, Elmo, above. First stop is ancient Egypt, which you might say is brought to you by the letter T: Telly plays King Tut, who collects treasure and loves triangles. Then it's on to a prehistoric scene, in which Bert and Ernie meet a boogieing blue dinosaur. In the midst of this merrymaking, the book's colors start to disappear. The situation becomes critical when Oscar the Grouch turns snow white and starts singing the praises of puppies and rainbows. A world without a grumpy Oscar is just, well, colorless. The audience helps solve the mystery while enjoying numbers like ''Red-Hot Tango'' and Cookie Monster's ''Fuzzy and Blue'' (to the tune of ''It Had to Be You''). A children's show about color usually also has something to say about the diversity of people. ''Elmo's Coloring Book'' does it gently, emphasizing friendship. Or, as one song puts it, ''It takes all of us to make a rainbow.''
