(13) STING: SONGS FROM THE LABYRINTH -- ''The songs of John Dowland have been gentlyhaunting me forover 20 years,'' Sting said of the English composer and court musician who was born in 1563 during an age of religious and political discord. ''For me they are pop songs written around 1600 and I relate to them in that way: beautiful melodies, fantastic lyrics and great accompaniments.'' In this ''Great Performances'' special, filmed at his estates in England and Italy, Sting (above) performs songs like ''Can She Excuse My Wrongs,'' ''Come Again,'' ''Flow My Tears'' and ''In Darkness Let Me Dwell'' with Edin Karamazov, a lutenist, and recites lines from Dowland's personal correspondence. 8 P.M. (Fox) PRISON BREAK -- The pieces are starting to fit into place. Tonight, Lincoln, Michael and Sara find the evidence they need to expose the conspiracy; Mahoneforces C-Note to lure Michael and Lincoln into the open; Kellerman sets his sights on the president; and -- could it be? -- T-Bag chooses the high road. But how long he stays on course is anyone's guess. 9 P.M. (Sundance) THE LAST MOGUL -- (2005). During the last half of the 20th century, Lew Wasserman became the most powerful of Hollywood's power brokers and, as president of the MCA talent agency, a sort of oneman replacement for the deteriorating studio system. In this documentary, Barry Avrich untangles facts and fictions about Wasserman (above), and takes on the rumor that he may have engineered Ronald Reagan's political career. 10 P.M. (ABC) BUILDING A DREAM: THE OPRAH WINFREY LEADERSHIP ACADEMY -- On Jan. 2, Ms. Winfrey opened the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls, a $40 million independent school in South Africa created, she said at a news conference, ''to give this opportunity to girls who had a light so bright that not even poverty could dim that light.'' This hourlong special traces Ms. Winfrey's five-year effort to erect the 28-building campus in Henley-on-Klip, south of Johannesburg, which will educate 152 girls ages 11 and 12. It also looks at some of the students' stories. 10 P.M. (NBC) THE BLACK DONNELLYS -- Talk about lineage. Paul Haggis and Bobby Moresco are the creators and executive producers of this new crime series about four workingclass Irish-American brothers (from near right, Thomas Guiry, Billy Lush, Jonathan Tucker and Michael Stahl-David) who live by their motto of ''family first'' despite their involvement with organized crime in New York. Mr. Haggis wrote the screenplay for ''Million Dollar Baby,'' which won the best picture Oscar in 2005. Last year, Mr. Haggis and Mr. Moresco won Oscars for their screenplay for ''Crash,'' which also earned Mr. Haggis, its director, a best picture Oscar. ''Donnellys'' is said to be based, however loosely, on Mr. Moresco's life -- the part before the fame and fortune.
