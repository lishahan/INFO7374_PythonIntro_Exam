Presenters include Ben Affleck, Cate Blanchett, George Clooney, Daniel Craig, Rachel Weisz, Kate Winslet, Reese Witherspoon, Tom Cruise, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and Nicole Kidman. Celebrity arrivals will be swooned over on ''Live From the Red Carpet: The 2007 Academy Awards'' at 6 on E!; ''An Evening at the Academy Awards: The Arrivals'' at 6:30 on ABC; and ''Road to the Oscars 2007'' at 8 on ABC. Post-festivity specials include ''Live 2007 Academy Awards Post-Show'' at midnight on E!, and ''Jimmy Kimmel Live: After the Academy Awards,'' featuring Ms. DeGeneres (above) and scenes from the five best picture nominees, performed by Guillermo, a security guard, at 12:05 a.m. 7 P.M. (NBC) DATELINE NBC -- This investigation into the fatal polonium poisoning of Alexander V. Litvinenko, a dissident former K.G.B. agent, includes interviews with Mr. Litvinenko's widow, Marina, and Boris A. Berezovsky, an exiled Russian tycoon and a bitter opponent of the Kremlin. 7 P.M. (ABC) THE BARBARA WALTERS SPECIAL -- Ms. Walters goes for the soft spot with guests like Ellen DeGeneres, the host of this year's Oscars; Jennifer Hudson and Eddie Murphy of ''Dreamgirls''; and the ever steely Helen Mirren (far left, with Ms. Walters) of ''The Queen.'' Good luck with that one. 8 P.M. (NBC) GREASE: YOU'RE THE ONE THAT I WANT -- But in the case of one Danny and one Sandy, they're the two that the judges don't want to continue their quest for Broadway. Afterwards, Frankie Avalon performs with the four remaining Sandys. 8 P.M. (13) ANDES: THE DRAGON'S BACK -- They rose like a spine from the sea and created a new continent and a bridge that joined North and South America, allowing flora and fauna from each to mix and diversify. Today, the Andes mountain range (above) continues to grow and evolve, and is home to a rich tapestry of ecosystems, including the largest ice field outside the poles, a desert where penguins nest, and geysers that stretch a mile high. 10 P.M. (Discovery) YOU SPOOF DISCOVERY -- Viewers turn on their video cameras to poke fun at their favorite Discovery Channel shows. 10 P.M.
