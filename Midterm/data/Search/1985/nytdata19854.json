But Dr. Robert J. Sternberg, an expert on love, says people can do better. The key to a successful romance, and to a good Valentine's Day gift, said Dr. Sternberg, a psychologist at Yale University who is studying the nature of love, is making the other person feel you can be counted on ''to value me as a person, not as some image, as a professor or lawyer or teacher, but as myself.'' ''The selection has to be really tailored,'' Dr. Sternberg said in an interview in his cluttered office.

The fans watching the so-called ''legends'' in the old-timers' game saw the yards of tape wrapped around George Yardley's knees, but only he and his surgeon fully appreciate what lies beneath the tape. With one reconstructed knee and one basically artificial knee, Yardley got the most out of his five minutes - his first basket and his first two rebounds since he retired in 1962 and his knees fell apart. Yardley's enthusiasm at being back in the scoring column again was just another highlight of what is becoming one of the more joyous events in sports - the midseason jamboree that includes a slam-dunk contest, an old-timers' game and today's All-Star Game, not to mention the parties and the homecoming feeling that no other sport quite matches in its all-star efforts.

Edward S.

''I thought of Gary Cooper wearing that Quaker outfit,'' Mr. Feldman recalled, ''and I asked myself, 'Who today is a reactive kind of actor who would also look funny in an outfit like that?' '' Harrison Ford came to mind, and the movie was on its way. When Mr. Feldman first came across a draft of the screenplay, by Earl W. Wallace and William Kelley, it was much longer, with sections taking almost a documentarylike approach to the Amish and their customs. ''There was nothing wrong with the writing, but it really needed editing,'' Mr. Feldman recalled. It needed enough to make 20th Century- Fox pass up the screenplay twice; later on, when Mr. Feldman optioned it himself and took the idea to other studios, some had reservations about whether Mr. Ford could carry the whole film.
