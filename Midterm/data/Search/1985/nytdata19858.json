STERN IS HOLDing forth at a wooden table in the threadbare circular conference room of his West Side Manhattan office. ''When I design a house,'' he says, plucking the roof off the small cardboard model of a shingle-style house soon to be built on waterfront property in one of the Hamptons, ''it looks like a house, not like a dry run for a bank or a frustrated airport.'' Stern is speaking in his usual emphatic tone. Houses, after all, are his business.

Best known for his iconoclastic staging of Wagner's ''Ring of the Niebelung'' for the Bayreuth Centenary - aired on PBS - he is also a renowned actor, theater director as well as administrator, and filmmaker. It is this last category that seems to concern the 40-year-old Frenchman most these days, as his film ''The Wounded Man'' (''L'Homme blesse'' opens Friday at the Waverly. Like other works of Mr. Chereau's multi- faceted career, it sparked tremendous controversy when it was presented at the 36th Cannes Film Festival - and went on to win the French Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. Co-written by the director Herve Guibert, ''The Wounded Man'' tells the harrowing tale of Henri (Jean- Hugues Anglade), a lonely 18-year- old boy in French provincial city who becomes obsessed with an older thief, Jean (Vittorio Mezzogiorno). He first encounters this dangerous and seductive figure in the train station - a locale whose literal and figurative lower depths overtake the impressionable adolescent. Constantly searching for the elusive Jean, Henri assumes his characteristics - until his frustrated love leads him to a violent climax.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "32", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "PATRICE CHEREAU-FRANCE'S TRIPLE THREAT TO THE ARTS"}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "TERMS NOT AVAILABLE"}], "pub_date": "1985-01-13T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Arts and Leisure Desk", "section_name": "Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Annette", "rank": 1, "lastname": "INSDORF"}], "original": "By ANNETTE INSDORF"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd1402e8eb7c8105d61738d", "word_count": 1791, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/13/us/cie-frazier-dead-at-81-new-orleans-musician.html", "snippet": "Josiah (Cie) Frazier, a drummer who began playing in the early years of traditional jazz in New Orleans and toured with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, died of pneumonia Thursday at Touro Infirmary.

After 30-odd years of on-and-off barnstorming in the Richard Rodgers-Oscar Hammerstein 2d classic, Mr. Brynner is, quite simply, The King. Man and role have long since merged into a fixed image that is as much a part of our collective consciousness as the Statue of Liberty. One doesn't go to Mr. Brynner's ''farewell engagement'' at the Broadway to search for any fresh interpretive angles - heaven forbid! One goes to bow. In its current rendition, Mr. Brynner's King cannot, in any case, be called mechanical. The performance is ritualistic, all right, but the high stylization the actor brings to every regal stance, arrogant hoot and snarling declaration of ''etcetera'' has the timelessness of Kabuki, not the self- parody of camp.

F. Murray Abraham, who makes his starring-role debut as Salieri in ''Amadeus,'' is expected to be a cinch to win an Oscar nomination for that performance and, according to some knowledgeable Hollywood residents, he has a very good chance of winning the top award. For years, John Malkovich has been a force on the Chicago stage as one of the original members of the Steppenwolf Theater. In 1984, after starring in the Off Broadway hit production of Sam Shepard's ''True West,'' he not only directed the acclaimed Off Broadway revival of Lanford Wilson's ''Balm in Gilead,'' but made his film debut with two stunning performances - in ''Places in the Heart'' and ''The Killing Fields.'' The following is a list of 14 performers who, on the basis of their work in last year's films, seem to be sure things, if not for stardom then at least for continuing careers on the screen.
