Also nominated were Roland Joffe for ''The Killing Fields,'' based on Sydney Schanberg's New York Times Magazine article about the Cambodian assistant who was left behind when the Khmer Rouge took over Cambodia in 1975, and David Lean for ''A Passage to India,'' the movie version of E.

They include jazz musicians' hangouts, such as Bradley's on University Place where the centerpiece - or, more literally, the cornerpiece - is a piano that belonged to the alto saxophonist Paul Desmond, or the Carnegie Tavern, behind Carnegie Hall, where both performers and audience gather before or after the concerts there. A piano-fest this weekend could include a world-famous jazz celebrity, George Shearing. Although Mr. Shearing was born in London, he is a New York jazz product. His fame stems from his arrival here almost 40 years ago. It was in New York that he organized the quintet with which he gained stardom in 1949 and it was while he was playing at Birdland, a 50's club named for the saxophonist Charlie (Yardbird) Parker, that he composed his best-known piece, ''Lullaby of Birdland.''", "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "JAZZ PIANOS, 88 KEYS TO THE CITY"}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "MUSIC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CONCERTS AND RECITALS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "JAZZ"}], "pub_date": "1985-02-01T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Weekend Desk", "section_name": "Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "John", "middlename": "S.", "lastname": "WILSON", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By JOHN S.

People prize him above all for paintings in which pretty young women are portrayed with every last detail of their elaborate High Victorian costumes set out intact.
