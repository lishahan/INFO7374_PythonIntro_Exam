He was 94 years old. Mr. Zimbalist, along with Jascha Heifetz, Mischa Elman and Nathan Milstein, was one of the distinguished alumni of Leopold Auer's legendary violin classes in Czarist St. Petersburg. From his first American appearance in 1911 - when he played the United States premiere of Alexander Glazunov's ''Concerto in A minor'' with the Boston Symphony Orchestra - until his retirement from the concert stage more than 40 years later, Mr. Zimbalist was acclaimed by colleagues, critics and the general public as one of the most respected musical figures of his time.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "9", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "EFREM ZIMBALIST, VIOLINIST, DIES AT 94"}, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "ZIMBALIST, EFREM"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DEATHS"}], "pub_date": "1985-02-23T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Cultural Desk", "section_name": "Arts; Obituaries", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Tim", "rank": 1, "lastname": "PAGE"}], "original": "By TIM PAGE"}, "type_of_material": "Obituary", "_id": "4fd1603d8eb7c8105d649aa3", "word_count": 861, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/23/world/guatemala-schedules-elections.html", "snippet": "Guatemalans will elect a civilian President and members of Congress on Oct. 24, and the nation's military chiefs will hand over power on Jan. 14, 1986, the Government announced today.

She might also like this camera- shaped shoulder bag to carry her lunch to school or her sunglasses and lotion to the beach, come summer. The body of the camera is black, the see-through lens and strap come in orange, green, blue or yellow, and a sliding door in back allows access to the contents. The bag sells for $12.50 at Stephen Anson, 1058 First Avenue (between 57th and 58th Streets). 3.A Robot for Neatness The robot with a heart is actually a child-size shoe bag that should encourage neatness, for what youngster could resist putting away shoes in one of its six compartments? The red heart and lips stand out against a blue body with white hands, feet and antennae. The fabric is a blend of polyester and cotton lined with polyester batting.

Critics had appreciated Mr. Bridges' performance as an awkward alien trying to get comfortable in a recently acquired human body in ''Starman.'' But any number of critically praised performances were not nominated - including Jack Lemmon's soothing priest in ''Mass Appeal,'' Robert Redford's aging baseball player in ''The Natural,'' and Matthew Modine and Nicolas Cage as friends helping each other battle insanity in ''Birdie.'' Nor was Steve Martin nominated for his performance as a different kind of creature - a man sharing his body with a woman in ''All of Me'' - despite Mr. Martin's awards as best actor from two major groups of critics. There is no assembly line capable of making keys that will unlock the Academy door. But, according to a number of Hollywood publicists, there are necessary elements that will help the keys to fit.
