The good ideas are usually deemed too advanced and dropped, as if the benighted members of that market have bad, or nonexistent, taste. Murjani's licensing agreement with Coca- Cola to produce Coca-Cola Clothes, as they are being called, may be an exception. The clothes are surprisingly good, which is why Tommy Hilfiger, who is 33 years old and who designed the collection, has such a big smile these days. Naturally, the collections for men and women each include the requisite five-button jeans (with a prominently displayed logo on back). But the collection is satisfyingly diverse. The clothes vary from crisp windbreakers and cotton chinos to brightly colored sweat clothes to jackets in traditional school stripes. Better still, there are trendy but well-designed items, including stirrup pants in sweat fabrics, beautifully cut polo shirts, cardigan sweaters with crests. And there are items that look like hot-weather hot sellers, including the Coca-Cola cotton sweaters with the logo emblazoned across the front in a spongy material.
