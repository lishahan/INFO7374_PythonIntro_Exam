SOMEWHERE between the worlds of Evelyn Waugh and Harold Pinter lies a whole prickly realm of English social life. Angry, punctilious, alarmed and lonely people fight each other off with what they take to be good manners, and occasionally unearth aspects of themselves that are so shocking they can only bury them again immediately or cultivate them in the quietest corridors of secrecy. The English are often said to be especially tolerant of eccentrics, and they are. But this is in part because their normality itself is so strange, so full of jumps and twitches.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "27", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "THE ENGLISH AT THEIR VICES"}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "TERMS NOT AVAILABLE"}], "pub_date": "1985-02-17T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Book Review Desk", "section_name": "Arts; Books", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Michael", "rank": 1, "lastname": "Wood"}], "original": "By Michael Wood; Michael Wood, author of ''Stendhal'' and ''America in the Movies,'' is a professor of English at the University of Exeter"}, "type_of_material": "Review", "_id": "4fd140398eb7c8105d6179db", "word_count": 1023, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/17/movies/film-view-ann-margret-produces-yet-another-surprise.html", "snippet": "One of the highest compliments that can be paid to a performer who's been around awhile is that he or she is still capable of eliciting surprise.

Ann-Margret, the initially brassy, belting, singing-dancing actress who made her film debut in 1961 at the age of 20, has been more or less surprising us with regularity since 1971, when she won her first Oscar nomination for her work in the bitterly funny Mike Nichols-Jules Feiffer comedy, ''Carnal Knowledge.'' After ''Carnal Knowledge,'' surprise has become so built into her career that we almost take it for granted. There were her extraordinary physical recovery and return to nightclubs just three months after a near-fatal fall backstage at Las Vegas in 1972, and then her second Oscar nomination for ''Tommy'' in 1975. In the following years there have been wonderfully adroit, comic performances - as Flavia, the dangerously young wife to an ancient Trevor Howard in Marty Feldman's ''Last Remake of Beau Geste,'' and as the lascivious Lady Booby in Tony Richardson's vastly underrated film adaptation of ''Joseph Andrews'' - and equally serious performances, the most spectacular being her work as Blanche Dubois in last year's television adaptation of ''A Streetcar Named Desire.''

In the wake of ''Dune'' and ''2010'' and their disappointing showings, not to mention the long shadow cast by ''E.T.,'' science fiction films will be stressing the human aspects of their stories rather than the ray guns. At least that will be true for the next two science- fiction efforts, Paramount's ''Explorers'' and Fox's ''Cocoon,'' both scheduled for summer release and both to have special effects by Lucasfilm's Industrial Light and Magic, although the sci-fi wizardry will not be overemphasized. ''Explorers,'' directed by Joe Dante, is about kids who build an S-ship in their backyard and actually undertake S-travel, but it will be promoted mostly as a human story. As for ''Cocoon,'' which is being directed by Ron Howard, the film to remember is Mr. Howard's ''Splash!'' ''It'll have the same very good-natured, warm, human feeling, but on a much bigger canvas,'' said Fox's marketing vice president, Jack Brodsky.
