Of course she would! How could she not? It is barely an exaggeration to say that you can't have an awards season without Ms. Streep, who has been enmeshed in roughly half of them since 1979, when she was nominated for best supporting actress in ''The Deer Hunter.'' She won that category the next year, for ''Kramer vs. Kramer,'' and was nominated in it once again, in 2003, for ''Adaptation.'' Those three supporting nods are filigree on top of the 13 nominations for best actress, which she won on her second try, in 1983, for ''Sophie's Choice.''", "abstract": "A O Scott article on Meryl Streep, who has received her 16th Oscar nomination as best actress in a leading role for Julia and Julia; attention to nuance and thoroughness of preparation described; photos (L)", "print_page": "1", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "That Unmistakable Streepness", "kicker": "FILM"}, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "JULIE AND JULIA (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "STREEP, MERYL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOVIES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ACADEMY AWARDS (OSCARS)"}], "pub_date": "2010-02-21T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Arts and Leisure Desk", "section_name": "Movies; Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "A.", "middlename": "O.", "lastname": "SCOTT", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By A.

Ralph Fiennes also stars as the lawyer she seduced when he was 15 (played as a teenager by David Kross, above with Ms. Winslet). ''Although the commercial imperatives that drive a movie like this one are understandable -- the novel was a best seller and an Oprah's Book Club selection, for starters -- you have to wonder who, exactly, wants or perhaps needs to see another movie about the Holocaust that embalms its horrors with artfully spilled tears and asks us to pity a death-camp guard,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times.
