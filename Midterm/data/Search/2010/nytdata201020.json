The group released only one album, \"Holy Cow,\" but it had guest appearances from members of Devo (who had a little something to do with the track called \"How Can the Labouring Man Find Time for Self-Culture?\") and the B-52s, as well as Bud Cort (\"Harold and Maude\") and Judge Reinhold. Good god, the Internet is just fantastic.The video, for \"Reach,\" includes cameos by Mr. Reinhold, Paul Reiser and actors from \"Aliens\" and \"Terminator,\" and is, of course, set in the Wild West. Ms. Bigelow stars as the leader of an outlaw band of female gunslingers who manage to persuade a few good-time gals to join them.
