The impact of her story about black women oppressed and then liberated was unusually intense and almost mystical. The four are Whoopi Goldberg, who plays Celie, the chattel of two men, who finally breaks free; Akosua Busia as Nettie, Celie's younger sister; Oprah Winfrey, who portrays Sophia, Celie's feisty and brutally treated stepdaughter-in-law, and Margaret Avery as Shug, the radiant, sensual singer who is worshiped by both Celie and her husband. Miss Goldberg has just been nominated for an Academy Award as best actress.

Jeffrey Katzenberg had rashly volunteered to dance if ''Down and Out in Beverly Hills,'' the top-grossing movie in the country in its first weekend of business, did even better in its second weekend, and studio executives refused to begin the Monday meeting until he performed. The film is the first movie project announced by Disney's new management team when it took over the studio 17 months ago. The satire about an insecure nouveau-riche family whose life is invaded by a bum increased its ticket sales from $5.7 million to $6.1 million, a sure sign that audiences were telling their friends to go see the movie. It is rare for a movie to increase ticket sales in its second weekend, and a drop of less than 15 percent is considered good.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "25", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "THE SUCCESSFUL RISE OF DISNEY'S 'DOWN AND OUT'"}, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "DOWN AND OUT IN BEVERLY HILLS (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "KATZENBERG, JEFFREY"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "DISNEY, WALT, PRODUCTIONS INC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}], "pub_date": "1986-02-13T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Cultural Desk", "section_name": "Movies; Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Aljean", "rank": 1, "lastname": "HARMETZ"}, {"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 2}], "original": "By ALJEAN HARMETZ, Special to the New York Times"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd1499b8eb7c8105d626c4e", "word_count": 1073, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/11/style/milena-canonero-fashion-on-and-off-the-big-screen.html", "snippet": "A young woman searched the lobby of a theater showing the film ''Out of Africa'' one recent night, turned to her companion and said, ''If they had a concession stand selling the clothes in this movie, I'd buy a whole new wardrobe.''

Milena Canonero, the designer who has just earned an Academy Award nomination in costume design for the rugged but sensual safari styles of ''Out of Africa,'' has heard such talk before. In 1981, she dressed the athletes in ''Chariots of Fire'' and her Academy Award-winning 1920's designs inspired a fashion trend.
