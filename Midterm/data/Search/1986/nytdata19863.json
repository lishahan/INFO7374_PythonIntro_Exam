So the series about a team of secret agents whose instructions self-destructed each week will be turned into a movie at Paramount. Peter Graves, who headed the television team after the show's first season, will co-star with three unknowns, and Mr. Feldman hopes the team members Greg Morris, Peter Lupus, Martin Landau and Barbara Bain will make cameo appearances. Paramount, which has had major success with three ''Star Trek'' movies, is also making a movie version of ''The Untouchables'' directed by Brian De Palma. At the moment, Mr. Feldman is the happy producer of ''Witness,'' which has been nominated for eight Academy Awards. Released last February, ''Witness'' defied the odds. ''Pictures released early in the year are almost never remembered,'' he said. ''I thought 'Mask' would be a major contender and Cher had a lock for best actress. I thought 'Purple Rose of Cairo' would be one of the five nominated best pictures. And 'The Breakfast Club' got exceptional reviews. 'Witness' couldn't have made it except that it ran six or eight months, long enough to keep it in the public's mind.''", "abstract": null, "print_page": "8", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "AT THE MOVIES"}, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "ACADEMY AWARDS (OSCARS)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "COLOR PURPLE, THE (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (TV PROGRAM)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "CRITICAL CONDITION (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "LATINO (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "SPIELBERG, STEVEN"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "APTED, MICHAEL"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "FELDMAN, ED"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECORDINGS (VIDEO)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CASSETTES"}], "pub_date": "1986-02-21T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Weekend Desk", "section_name": "Movies; Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Aljean", "rank": 1, "lastname": "Harmetz"}, {"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 2}], "original": "By Aljean Harmetz, Special to the New York Times"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd160d68eb7c8105d64ad86", "word_count": 1196, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/20/world/official-of-paper-aiding-aquino-shot.html", "snippet": "An executive for a leading newspaper in the United States opposed to President Ferdinand E.

The contacts have involved only a handful of scholars, and there has been some reticence and political tiptoeing on both sides, according to Dr. C. C. Lamberg-Karlovsky, an archeologist at Harvard University who is one of the organizers of the exchanges. The Soviet scholars, for example, have refrained from discussing their recent archeological work in Afghanistan, where Soviet troops are helping Afghan Government forces fight rebels; in the past the Americans, slightly nervous about being criticized by other scholars at home, had avoided publicizing their Soviet work. Exciting and Puzzling Ties Yet the academic link is regarded by a variety of top American archeologists as important, exciting, anomalous and, at times, puzzling. They cite the following developments, among others: * Some of the most prestigious archeologists on both sides have visited fellow specialists. The Americans include not only Dr. Lamberg-Karlovsky, who is director of Harvard's influential Peabody Museum of Archeology and Ethnology and is a widely known expert on the early Middle Eastern civilizations, but also Dr. Robert McC.
