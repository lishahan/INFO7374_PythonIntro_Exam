The heroine of the black-tie gathering, which included practically every designer you can think of, was clearly Katharine Hepburn, who described herself as ''the original bag lady'' and expressed surprise that she was chosen as a symbol of style. The big topic among the 310 invited guests as the evening started at 6 P.M. was whether the actress, a notably private person, would stop by to pick up her award for ''lifetime achievement'' and for inspiring generations of designers. She slipped into place next to Calvin Klein just as the floating island dessert was being served and after the Astor Hall had been cleared of photographers. Journalists who tried to speak with her were turned back firmly by security guards.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "5", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "DESIGNERS' SALUTE LEADS OFF WITH HEPBURN"}, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "HEPBURN, KATHARINE"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "FASHION DESIGNERS OF AMERICA, COUNCIL OF"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AWARDS, DECORATIONS AND HONORS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "APPAREL"}], "pub_date": "1986-01-21T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Style Desk", "section_name": "Style", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Bernadine", "rank": 1, "lastname": "MORRIS"}], "original": "By BERNADINE MORRIS"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd160d68eb7c8105d64ad58", "word_count": 943, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/19/books/the-highest-passion-is-terrour.html", "snippet": "HAWKSMOOR By Peter Ackroyd. 217 pp. New York: Harper & Row. $16.95.

AT the conclusion of Peter Ackroyd's ''Last Testament of Oscar Wilde'' - a work of fiction imagined in Wilde's own voice - the dying Wilde, exiled and dishonored, fantasizes entering into another man's heart as a way of salvation: ''In that moment of transition, when I was myself and someone else, of my own time and in another's, the secrets of the universe would stand revealed.'' At the conclusion of Mr. Ackroyd's new novel, ''Hawksmoor,'' this mystical transformation occurs as the spiritually exhausted Hawksmoor - a senior detective assigned to investigate a series of murders committed on the sites of certain 18th-century churches - enters into an alliance of sorts with the very murderer he seeks, a devil worshiper named Nicholas Dyer: ''And his own Image was sitting beside him . . . and when he put out his hand and touched him he shuddered. . . . They were face to face, and yet they looked past one another at the pattern which they cast upon the stone . . . and who could say where one had ended and the other had begun?'' It is a measure of the author's ingenuity (and, perhaps, his audacity) that while Hawksmoor is our contemporary, Dyer lived and died in the early 18th century.

But if it was as good as Miss Caudwell's second book, THE SHORTEST WAY TO HADES (Scribners, $12.95), the loss was ours. In ''Hades'' the plotting is fairly traditional, down to the expected encounter between killer and investigator. But it's all in the telling, and the pseudonymous author tells her story in a kind of English that has not been around since the days of Oscar Wilde. Most of the characters speak in rounded periods, often with a touch of malicious wit. '' 'Vashti's?' said Ragwort, with austere disapproval. 'Vashti's has a most unsavoury reputation. I have heard it spoken of as a place frequented by females of unnatural propensity, seeking companions in disgraceful conduct.' '' To which Ragwort's friend Selena answers, ''I have heard it spoken of as an agreeable little establishment where single women may enjoy one another's company in relaxed and convivial surroundings.'' The narrator and amateur detective of this book is a legal scholar named Hilary Tamar. Basically he is a historian, and he describes his profession as ''speaking ill of the dead.'' He is questioning a young man who is terribly impatient with his parents and says some ill-advised things about them, concluding with the statement ''Parents can be very difficult.'' Tamar has only one comment: ''They have suffered a traumatic experience - you must make allowances.''", "abstract": null, "print_page": "17", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "CRIME"}, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "SHORTEST WAY TO HADES, THE (BOOK)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "CAUDWELL, SARAH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BOOK REVIEWS"}], "pub_date": "1986-01-19T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Book Review Desk", "section_name": "Arts; Books", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Newgate", "rank": 1, "lastname": "Callendar"}], "original": "By Newgate Callendar"}, "type_of_material": "Review", "_id": "4fd1499c8eb7c8105d626c9c", "word_count": 1360, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/19/books/best-sellers.html", "snippet": "Jan. 19, 1986 Fiction    * 1 1 9 THE MAMMOTH HUNTERS, by Jean M.

ON a February night in 1899, the President of the French Republic, Felix Faure, died of a stroke, and rumor quickly spread that he had departed in a paroxysm of amorous pleasure that was hazardous to the health of an overweight bourgeois. The following year, across the Seine near the Ecole des Beaux Arts, Oscar Wilde suffered an acute brain inflammation and achieved a final, tragic blend of art and life; like his earnest rake, Ernest Worthing, he died in a Paris hotel room, oppressed, the legend goes, by ghastly wallpaper.

The British-born actress has a presence so rare that, over the years, critics have outdone themselves trying to describe it: She flutters like a beautiful butterfly. She rises like an undulating coil of smoke forming into unpredictable billows. She moves like a magical, mesmerizing gauze. At the moment, she is sitting quietly - no smoke or gauze or flutter -in an East Side restaurant, pondering the question posed: Is such stage presence a natural, or an acquired, trait?

He started the Decoding Society after working with the three leading figures in free jazz - Ornette Coleman, Cecil Taylor and the late Albert Ayler.
