In making the ruling, United States District Judge Robert L. Carter reversed a decision by a court-appointed fact-finder. Judge Carter, in upholding an appeal by the league, said that although the five-year offer to King, which included a $960,000 signing bonus, would have technically kept the Knicks within the salary limit that expires after next season, the offer was ''a stark case of intentional circumvention'' that could not be allowed.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "30", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "KNICK OFFER TO KING IS RULED IMPROPER"}, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "KING, ALBERT"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "CARTER, ROBERT L"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSN"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NEW YORK KNICKERBOCKERS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "WAGES AND SALARIES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BASKETBALL"}], "pub_date": "1986-02-07T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Sports Desk", "section_name": "Sports", "subsection_name": null, "byline": null, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd160d28eb7c8105d64aa10", "word_count": 536, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/07/movies/at-the-movies.html", "snippet": "Hollywood is always full of puzzled - and, often, sore - losers the day after the Academy Award nominations are announced.

However, Steven Spielberg's failure to get an Oscar nomination for ''The Color Purple'' has caused unusual shock waves. ''The Color Purple,'' the screen version of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about impoverished black women, won 11 nominations including best picture. Only once in the Academy's 58 years has the director of a movie nominated for 10 or more awards failed to get a nomination himself. In 1942, Sam Wood was passed over for ''Pride of the Yankees.'' Since Academy members in the same field make the nominations, it was the actors, for example, who nominated Whoopi Goldberg, Margaret Avery and Oprah Winfrey for their performances in ''The Color Purple,'' and the cinematographers who nominated Allen Daviau. The talk in Hollywood today was about whether the Academy's 230 directors overlooked Mr. Spielberg because they were jealous of his immense commercial success - even ''The Color Purple'' is an unexpected box-office hit - or because they didn't think the movie was an outstanding achievement in directing.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "10", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "AT THE MOVIES"}, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "COLOR PURPLE, THE (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "SPIELBERG, STEVEN"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}], "pub_date": "1986-02-07T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Weekend Desk", "section_name": "Movies; Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Aljean", "rank": 1, "lastname": "Harmetz"}, {"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 2}], "original": "By Aljean Harmetz, Special to the New York Times"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd16d278eb7c8105d65f960", "word_count": 1299, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/06/garden/design-notebook-architects-drawings-lure-collectors.html", "snippet": "''THE painter sketches to paint, the sculptor draws to carve, and the architect draws to build,'' the late Louis Kahn once wrote.

Architects tend to put pencil to paper mainly for practical reasons, not for the sake of art. After serving the utilitarian purpose, ''to build,'' the architect's drawings tend to stay, more or less, in his or the client's files. Lately, however, architecture as a subject has become much more accessible, and architects not quite so anonymous. While they still draw to build, they now often draw or paint - as does one of the most famous contemporaries, Michael Graves -for themselves, without commissioning from a client. And increasingly, their drawings - those done for practical use as well as pleasure- - are sought after by art collectors who once left the buying of such material to specialists in the field.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "ARCHITECTS' DRAWINGS LURE COLLECTORS", "kicker": "DESIGN NOTEBOOK"}, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "LUST, HERBERT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ARCHITECTURE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ART"}], "pub_date": "1986-02-06T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Home Desk", "section_name": "Home and Garden; Style", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Grace", "rank": 1, "lastname": "GLUECK"}], "original": "By GRACE GLUECK"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd15b238eb7c8105d641296", "word_count": 1263, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/06/movies/africa-and-purple-top-oscar-lists.html", "snippet": "With 11 nominations apiece, ''The Color Purple'' and ''Out of Africa'' led the 58th Academy Award nominations announced today.

Unexpectedly, they were joined in the race for best picture by a Brazilian movie, ''Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' which was nominated in four major categories. The English-language film, the story of a revolutionary and a homosexual who share a prison cell, won nominations for Hector Babenco, its director; Leonard Schrader, its screenwriter, and William Hurt as best actor for his performance as the homosexual window dresser who spins fantasies from old movies. ''The Color Purple,'' the story of a black woman's subjugation by her husband, and ''Out of Africa,'' the sprawling tale of the novelist Isak Dinesen's years as a coffee planter, will compete head to head in seven categories, including best picture, actress and cinematography. They will not, however, be in competition for the directing award. Although Sydney Pollack received a directing nomination for ''Out of Africa,'' Steven Spielberg of ''The Color Purple'' was passed over by the academy, in perhaps the biggest surprise of the day. Nominees are chosen by members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences who work in the same field. The 230 directors nominate for best director.
