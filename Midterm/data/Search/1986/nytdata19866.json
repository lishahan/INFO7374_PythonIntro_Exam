The car was the prize for his selection as the most valuable player in the 1966 game. ''With the exception of a new set of tires, the car is exactly the way it was when I drove it away that afternoon,'' said Smith. ''It has been driven about 40,000 miles. I drive it about 10 or 15 miles a week to keep the motor in shape.

You are an above-average guard in the National Basketball Association - about 6 feet 4 inches tall, with decent quickness and good defensive instincts. You are near midcourt, backpedaling as the opposition grabs a defensive rebound and quickly gets the ball to its point guard, who ignites a fast break. Here's the catch: leading the fast break is the most commanding playmaker in the game, Earvin (Magic) Johnson of the Los Angeles Lakers. The first thing that strikes you is his size. He's 6-9, three inches taller than any other starting point guard in the league. Then you notice his eyes. They are sparkling, darting left and right, surveying the space between you and the basket. Streaking down the floor to Johnson's right is James Worthy, the graceful 6-9 forward who is a first-time all-star this season. Filling the left lane is Michael Cooper, perhaps the game's best reserve.

Based on the true story of Adelaide Herculine Barbin, who lived in rural France in the second half of the 19th century, the new French film explores the mystery of a young French schoolteacher who, at age 22, is suddenly revealed to be not a young woman but a young man. This rather amazing revelation occurs when the schoolteacher, called Alexina in the film, and her pretty, flirty fellow-teacher, Sara, have been wrestling girlishly atop a bed. Amid the tossing of petticoats, Alexina becomes carried away by strange longings for Sara and does something out of character, or, at least, out of the character that apparently she and everyone else in the film have assumed to be hers. The saucy Sara, far from being affronted, couldn't be more delighted.

In modern show business parlance, an anthology of songs, and sometimes dances, masquerading as a musical. A musicalette is connected by music or lyrics of the same authorship or by thematic content. There is often an attempt to offer biographical and/or historical information in the guise of entertainment. See also musical revue, songbook, catalogue musical. No such definition appears in the dictionary, but perhaps it is time for the coinage and for reevaluation of what is often a self-defeating theatrical form. Most musicalettes fail, yet every year at least several new, or new-old, ones open. So far this season there have been three: ''Jerome Kern Goes to Hollywood,'' ''Uptown . . . It's Hot!'' and ''Jerry's Girls.''
