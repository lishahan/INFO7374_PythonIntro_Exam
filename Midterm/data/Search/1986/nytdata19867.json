On the wall hangs an expensive and flattering portrait of the owners, who look a good deal worse in the bed below. In fact, David (Richard Dreyfuss) and Barbara (Bette Midler) Whiteman are only nominally the heads of this household. They don't run it, it runs them. And everyone within their domain -sexually confused son (Evan Richards), anorectic daughter (Tracy Nelson), sultry maid (Elizabeth Pena) - is showing signs of strain. Life here isn't easy, not even for the family dog. The classic Talking Heads song ''Once in a Lifetime,'' which opens Paul Mazursky's ''Down and Out in Beverly Hills,'' wasn't written for the film, but it might as well have been: ''You may find yourself/In a beautiful house/With a beautiful wife/ You may ask yourself - Well?/How did I get here?''

Mr. Spielberg was nominated for ''The Color Purple,'' a screen version of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about the subjugation of a black woman by her husband.

The award was voted to Miss Aleandro at a meeting in New York in the third week of December. A few days later, the members of the National Society of Film Critics, many of whom are also in the New York Film Critics Circle, named Vanessa Redgrave the best actress of the same year for ''Wetherby.'' For reasons rather difficult to fathom, even to award-watchers, Miss Aleandro didn't figure in the National Society's balloting, though Meryl Streep did - for her performance in ''Out of Africa.'' Many of those attending the National Society's meeting had the queasy feeling that the final choice was less a vote for Miss Redgrave than against Miss Streep. No matter how good Miss Streep may be in ''Out of Africa,'' she has a couple of things going against her in any such balloting at the moment. There's one bunch of camp followers that feels that awards, like common colds, ought to be spread around, and that Miss Streep has already won her fair share, including Oscars for ''Kramer vs. Kramer'' and ''Sophie's Choice.''", "abstract": null, "print_page": "21", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "NO CHEERS FOR THOSE UBIQUITOUS AWARDS", "kicker": "FILM VIEW"}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AWARDS, DECORATIONS AND HONORS"}], "pub_date": "1986-01-26T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Arts and Leisure Desk", "section_name": "Movies; Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Vincent", "rank": 1, "lastname": "Canby"}], "original": "By Vincent Canby"}, "type_of_material": "Review", "_id": "4fd15fda8eb7c8105d64924b", "word_count": 1553, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/26/nyregion/long-island-journal-295186.html", "snippet": "THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY BEFORE last weekend, the smallest plane that Richard J.
