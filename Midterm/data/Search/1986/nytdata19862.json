Later, ''Wicked women bother one, good women bore one - that's the only difference.'' And near the end, ''A cynic is a man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.'' We are very definitely in the sparkling epigrammatic theater world of Oscar Wilde. These particular sallies happen to be from ''Lady Windermere's Fan,'' which can be seen at 9 this evening on cable's Arts and Entertainment network. The intriguing production was produced last year for the BBC by Louis Marks. The director is Tony Smith. ''Lady Windermere's Fan'' was written in 1892, three years before Wilde was arrested on a morals charge that would leave his life in ruins. On the surface, his plays, including ''An Ideal Husband'' and ''The Importance of Being Earnest,'' are somewhat brittle displays of wit, as formidable in their cleverness as are the hypocrisies of the society they attack. Wilde, in fact, has hardy roots in Restoration comedy. But beneath the always exquisite manners and settings, beneath the verbal gymnastics of his exercises, there can sometimes be found surprisingly dark recesses. Wilde was, after all, very Irish.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "17", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "'LADY WINDERMERE'S FAN' ON A&E CABLE CHANNEL", "kicker": "TV REVIEWS"}, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "LADY WINDERMERE'S FAN (TV PROGRAM)"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CABLE TELEVISION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TELEVISION"}], "pub_date": "1986-02-25T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Cultural Desk", "section_name": "Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "John", "middlename": "J.", "lastname": "O'CONNOR", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By JOHN J.
