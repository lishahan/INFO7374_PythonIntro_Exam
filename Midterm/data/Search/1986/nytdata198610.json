And in New York these days, the music of the Gershwins looks to be as durable as the love that outlasts geologic wonders. At the Ballroom on West 28th Street, you can hear, thanks to the technological marvel known as the reproducing piano, the composer himself accompanying the renowned 71-year-old mouth-organist Larry Adler through ''Rhapsody in Blue.'' Uptown in the Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel, Michael Feinstein, the young singer and pianist who spent six years cataloguing Ira Gershwin's records and sheet music, has begun an open-ended engagement that will include a hefty selection of Gershwin tunes. Mr. Feinstein's New York debut follows appearances in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Houston.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "17", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "IT'S VERY CLEAR, THE GERSHWINS ARE HERE TO STAY"}, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "ADLER, LARRY"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "GERSHWIN, GEORGE"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "GERSHWIN, IRA"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "FEINSTEIN, MICHAEL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MUSIC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CONCERTS AND RECITALS"}], "pub_date": "1986-01-10T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Weekend Desk", "section_name": "Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Stephen", "rank": 1, "lastname": "HOLDEN"}], "original": "By STEPHEN HOLDEN"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd149988eb7c8105d626a06", "word_count": 1085, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/10/world/kohl-explains-refusal-to-move-against-libya.html", "snippet": "Chancellor Helmut Kohl invoked West Germany's national interests and the lives of German expatriates today as he explained his Government's refusal to follow the United States in imposing economic sanctions on Libya.

Since he began making dances in 1980, he has choreographed to Brahms, Vivaldi, rock, gospel songs and traditional Tahitian and Indian music, and his themes have ranged from the intoxication of love to the social significance of wrestling. His refusal to limit himself to any single way of moving should gladden dancegoers who hate to see young choreographers fall into esthetic ruts. Mr. Morris has lots of ideas, including ideas about structure, and he enjoys trying out different ways of putting dances together. Take ''I Love You Dearly,'' which was offered during the Mark Morris Dance Group's recent season at the Bessie Schonberg Theater. This solo for Guillermo Resto, to a suite of Rumanian folk songs, made one recall that Mr. Morris once performed with a Balkan folk dance group. In fact, the suite's first dance was like a folk song made visible. At the beginning of each new stanza of the accompanying song, Mr. Resto would pause in a corner of the stage. Thus the dance, like the music, was stanzaic in structure.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "8", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "HOW NOT TO GET TRAPPED IN A CHOREOGRAPHIC RUT", "kicker": "DANCE VIEW"}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "TERMS NOT AVAILABLE"}], "pub_date": "1986-01-05T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Arts and Leisure Desk", "section_name": "Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Jack", "rank": 1, "lastname": "Anderson"}], "original": "By Jack Anderson"}, "type_of_material": "Review", "_id": "4fd16d2a8eb7c8105d65fbdb", "word_count": 1288, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/04/obituaries/herbert-magidson.html", "snippet": "Herbert Magidson, a lyricist who shared the first Academy Award for best song, died Thursday at the U.C.L.A.
