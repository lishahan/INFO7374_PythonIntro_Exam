The best have a bit of both. This spring, no matter what city they were created in, the clothes that look and feel the newest blend the by-now classic ease of men's-wear and sportswear separates with a shapely curviness that hugs the body, emphasizing the breasts, waist and hips - especially the hips. Such clothes bring together two currently strong yet disparate design directions that are interpreted in many different and individual ways in the collections of trend-setting designers in New York, Paris, London and Milan. The combination calls on designers' cleverest devices as well as on an interesting alchemy of fabric and form. The resultant fashions possess a sort of chic that seems tailor-made for the 1986 woman. They are feminine yet comfortable - easy to move around in at a fast pace.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "75", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "The New Chic Classic and Shapely"}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "WOMEN"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SPECIAL SECTIONS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "APPAREL"}], "pub_date": "1986-03-02T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Magazine Desk", "section_name": "Magazine", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Carrie", "rank": 1, "lastname": "Donovan"}], "original": "By Carrie Donovan"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd16d298eb7c8105d65faec", "word_count": 456, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/02/magazine/paris.html", "snippet": "Reverence for the fine arts, the applied arts and just plain style is basic to being French, and cultural curiosity is as inbred as the taste for lamb on Sunday or a tolerance for halfhearted heating and Lilliputian-sized elevators.

Definitive biographies and fictionalizations kept emerging, and Wilde himself spoke beyond the grave, for ''De Profundis'' was published uncut for the first time in 1960. The dangers in Wilde's case are further compounded by the fact that he self-consciously turned his own life into a fiction. One of his most persistent paradoxes, which he managed to make entirely convincing, was that life imitates art. His acquaintances all testified that Wilde's greatest art was his conversation.

Her biggest worry in making the transition to fiction was not having to work with actors, but the matter of staging. ''With a documentary, you go to the situation and cover the scene, you don't have to decide where to move,'' she said. ''But this time, I had to ask myself, 'How do you break a scene down? Where do you put the camera, and why?'
