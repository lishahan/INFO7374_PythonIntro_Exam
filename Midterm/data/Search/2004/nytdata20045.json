That the young tenor Juan Diego Fl\u00f3rez, the new prince of bel canto opera, made a dashing, boyish, and vocally dynamic Lindoro in the Metropolitan Opera's revival of Rossini's ''Italiana in Algeri'' was to be expected. The surprise here was the performance of the mezzo-soprano Olga Borodina in the title role of the Italian girl, Isabella. Who knew that this artist, whose rich voice and smoldering presence are so suited to weighty roles in Verdi and Mussorgsky, would have had the right comic touch and impressive coloratura technique for Rossini's sassy heroine? Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's stylish 1973 production could not have seemed fresher or funnier. The veteran Italian bass Ferruccio Furlanetto made a wonderfully blustery Mustafa, the Bey of Algiers who yearns for an Italian wife.
