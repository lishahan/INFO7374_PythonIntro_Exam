Boguslaw Sonik, a Krakow councilor, said the exhibition would be housed in a former pharmacy in the heart of the district where 17,000 Jews were forced to live from 1941 to 1943 and where a thousand were killed in the streets when the Nazis decided to empty it on March 13, 1943. The survivors were sent to the Plaszow labor camp, where Oskar Schindler, above, the focus of Mr. Spielberg's Oscar-winning 1993 film, ''Schindler's List,'' used influential friends and bribes to save 1,200 of them. MUSEUM PRESIDENT NAMED -- Stuart N. Brotman will become the president of the Museum of Television and Radio on March 1, according to an announcement yesterday by Frank A. Bennack Jr., its chairman.

Batscha, who served as president of the museum in New York and Los Angeles from 1981 until his death last year.
