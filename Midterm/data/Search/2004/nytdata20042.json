But by accident and by design, the events leading up to Sunday night's 76th annual festival of Hollywood self-regard were, if anything, even more the same than usual. The academy, the film industry and the gods of chance and history all seemed to be sparing no effort to ensure that this year's Oscars would be as normal, as uneventful and as predictable as possible -- to honor tradition by producing a generic extravaganza. Last fall in a fit of high-mindedness the academy decided to restrain the crass and unseemly campaigning that had marred previous years -- that is, that had made the run-up to the ceremony ever more colorful and entertaining for journalists and other would-be insiders. The handsomely printed document announcing stern new rules and restrictions had, without evident irony, lamented the incursion of hucksterism into the proceedings. Hucksterism in the movie business? Is nothing sacred?

Speculation that she may have been an extra he met on the set of ''The Last Samurai'' was immediately squashed when he announced, ''I'm showing off my mom tonight.'' That same evening a number of other celebrities were accompanied by those with whom they share a close genetic link. Among them were Mr. Cruise's former wife Nicole Kidman, who took her mother and father to the ceremony, proclaiming with a laugh: ''I bring either my kids or my parents. It's pathetic.'' Pathetic no, but strategic perhaps. At a time when red carpet appearances are analyzed with the kind of attention typically reserved for the decoding of strands of viral matter and the status of a celebrity's relationship is of more interest to the press than that of his career, family members -- mothers especially -- have become increasingly visible as companions to those whom fate has dispatched to the universe of award presentations and movie premieres. Jude Law and Johnny Depp, both nominated for Oscars in the best-actor category, are expected to take their mothers to the 76th annual Academy Awards tonight, as is Charlize Theron, a nominee for best actress, who is also taking her boyfriend, Stuart Townsend, an actor.
