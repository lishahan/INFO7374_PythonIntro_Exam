He starts by visiting a bank that gives away guns with new accounts, learns that Lockheed Martin (the weapons manufacturers and one of Littleton's largest employers) responded to the tragedy by giving money toward anger management courses, presents a cartoon version of American history narrated by a talking bullet and ends with an interview with Charlton Heston, who originally welcomes him because Mr. Moore is, oddly enough, a card-carrying member of the National Rifle Association. Surprise! -- Sunday at 8 p.m., Monday at 5:30 p.m. and Saturday at 9 p.m. on Showtime. You can't say Pedro Almod\u00f3var's 2002 film HABLE CON ELLA (''Talk to Her'') isn't original. It's the story of two men caring for two comatose women. Benigno (Javier C\u00e1mara) is the nurse for a young dancer (Leonor Watling) who was in a car accident. Others at the hospital don't know he had an obsession with her before the accident and even visited her g room porthole. The women in ''Sleepless in Seattle'' may worship ''An Affair to Remember,'' the 1957 version, with Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr, but there's something slightly more magical about the original -- Monday at 6:30 p.m. on TCM.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "6", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "MOVIES: CRITIC'S CHOICE"}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2004-02-15T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Television", "section_name": null, "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Anita", "rank": 1, "lastname": "Gates"}], "original": "By Anita Gates"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd24dc58eb7c8105d7eef89", "word_count": 476, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/15/movies/oscar-films-and-now-a-few-words-from-the-writers-finding-nemo.html", "snippet": "Excerpts from the nominees for best original screenplay were chosen by Polly Shulman.

Imagine Groucho Marx being tearily sincere or that lordly drunk W. C.

The performance is a dual triumph -- for the actor, who is marvelous, and for the director, Sofia Coppola, who conceived it with his persona in mind.
