And it's easy to see why. For Hardy, shoes -- like the Lido Girl (left, $1,560; call 011 33 1 42 60 59 75), a twinkling web of crystal-encrusted suede sprung from a heavy, conical base -- are more than fashion accessories; they are sculptural meditations on form, function, luxury and desire. For more than 20 years, Hardy has quietly transformed luxe accessory design: first as a shoe designer at Christian Dior; then at Herm\u00e8s, where he created the H sandal and for which he continues to design jewelry; and finally at his namesake collection, which he introduced in 1998. Since 2001, Hardy has also created shoes for Balenciaga, in a close collaboration with the label's designer Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re that has finally seen him transcend his cult status to emerge as the Philippe Starck of the stack heel.
