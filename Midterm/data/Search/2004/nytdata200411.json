R. R. Tolkien's fantasy epic, it looks like just what they've been longing to see: a trailer for a forthcoming movie version of ''The Hobbit,'' the book that introduces many of the characters in the ''Rings'' series. The illusion is almost perfect. The trailer, posted on the Internet, starts with the logo for New Line Cinema, the movie's producer, and includes images of wistful elves, misty mountains, flaming lakes and, of course, Gollum and Bilbo Baggins doing battle over that all-powerful ring. The shots are intense and evocative; the score is swelling and dramatic; and the stars, Ian Holm (Bilbo), Andy Serkis (Gollum) and Ian McKellen (the friendly wizard Gandalf), are all in view and all in focus. The trailer even includes a release date: Dec. 19, 2006.", "abstract": "Lord of the Rings fans are fooled by fake Web site, designed by college student Steve Latham, that looks like real trailer for forthcoming movie version of The Hobbit, book that introduces many of characters in 'Rings' series; film is unlikely to be made in near future because New Line Cinema holds production rights, but MGM/United Artists has distribution rights, and speedy agreement between two seems unlikely; photo (M)", "print_page": "24", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "After the King Returns, Will a 'Hobbit' Follow?", "kicker": "OSCAR FILMS"}, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "HOBBIT, THE (BOOK)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "LORD OF THE RINGS, THE (MOVIES)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "LATHAM, STEVE"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "UNITED ARTISTS"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NEW LINE CINEMA"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER INC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HOAXES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BOOKS AND LITERATURE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET"}], "pub_date": "2004-02-15T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Arts and Leisure Desk", "section_name": "Technology; Movies; Arts; Books", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Jesse", "rank": 1, "lastname": "McKINLEY"}], "original": "By JESSE McKINLEY"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd27b3c8eb7c8105d84078b", "word_count": 871, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/packages/khtml/2004/02/15/movies/oscars/20040215_OSCARS_FEATURE.html", "snippet": "Elvis Mitchell, A.O.

And it's obviously one of those films that you ''should'' see, but the ads made it look like such a downer. I think somebody gets killed. And I mean really killed, not like ''Lord of the Rings'' killed. Which, by the way, is a great movie. I saw it twice. Those battle scenes were awesome. I cried. Now that Peter Jackson has shown us what you can do with enough technology, I don't know why anyone would want to see a film like ''Mystic River'' -- which I understand is great. So thanks again to Clint Eastwood for believing in me, and especially to the special-effects wizards who created that Giant Spider.

For all the emotional soul-baring that goes into a memorable performance, acting is also a form of disguise, which succeeds to the degree that the actor disappears into the role. Yet with variants of Method acting dominating the screen, makeup and prosthetics tend to be regarded as useful novelty accouterments rather than tools for the discovery of emotional truth.

Such hyperbole on the part of a critic is always apt to raise an eyebrow or two -- not least among other critics -- but in this case my own brows are not budging. This is partly because I, too, admire Ms. Theron's work in ''Monster'' -- her intensity, her empathy and her ferocious dedication to expunging all vanity or irony from her performance. But it is also because for me to mock such a grand historical claim would be blatantly hypocritical. A few months before Mr. Ebert unleashed his praise on Ms. Theron, I was similarly extravagant in heralding the achievement of one of her fellow nominees, when I called Sean Penn's portrayal of Jimmy Markum in Clint Eastwood's ''Mystic River'' one of the definitive pieces of screen acting in the last half-century. In quantitative terms, I was perhaps more modest in my estimation of Mr. Penn's work than Mr. Ebert was in his judgment of Ms. Theron's -- a matter of 50 years as opposed to 100 or so. Anyway, what's a few decades between friends?
