The baring of her middle-aged flesh is not nearly so shocking, though, as her decision, about midway through the film, to discard the white turtleneck sweaters she wears like a talisman in favor of a black jersey T-shirt and skirt.

Disney, who has long been derided as ''Walt's idiot nephew,'' as he puts it, is actually an eloquent, thoughtful man who completes the daily crossword in ink. Yet he does have a quirky sense of humor that he tends to unleash at his own expense. One recent afternoon, while we were sitting in his living room with his wife and his oldest son, I looked up from my notepad and was astonished to see him tugging on both ears, dangling his tongue from his mouth and panting like an exhausted dog. ''Did you know,'' he asked me, ''that I was the model for Goofy?'' At 74, Disney is an affable, gray-haired man whose long face and squinty eyes lend him an uncanny likeness not to old Goofy -- for whom he did not actually pose -- so much as to their mutual forebear Walt. His temperament, though, is closer to that of his father, Roy O. Disney, the kinder, gentler and lesser-known of the entertainment empire's founders. Within the company, the younger Roy has always been viewed as an oddly nonchalant heir, indifferent to the seductions of power, content to spend his days tinkering with films and keeping court with the old-time animators whom he had watched, in his privileged boyhood, sketching scenes for ''Pinocchio'' and ''Fantasia'' on their storyboards.", "abstract": "Deborah Solomon article on Roy O Disney, nephew of Walt Disney, and his campaign to force Michael D Eisner out as chairman and chief executive of Walt Disney Co; photo (L)", "print_page": "20", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Reanimated"}, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "EISNER, MICHAEL D"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "DISNEY, ROY E"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "DISNEY, WALT, CO"}], "pub_date": "2004-02-22T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Magazine Desk", "section_name": "Magazine", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Deborah", "rank": 1, "lastname": "Solomon"}], "original": "By Deborah Solomon"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd24bbd8eb7c8105d7eb049", "word_count": 4664, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/22/magazine/a-little-bit-adorable.html", "snippet": "The horrible fear about having a conversation with Zac Posen is that he is going to say something to impress you.

There must be countless young New Yorkers to whom this need to impress people is not merely a habit, like brushing one's teeth, but a virtue, to be borne with purpose and alacrity so that, over time, it acquires polish, and, with more effort, a stainless perfection. But whenever I see Posen at a party or some industry event, I am struck by the fact that of all the designers in his age group -- he is 23 -- he feels this need to impress more urgently than the others. It is as if time for him were measured not in minutes and hours but rather in incremental opportunities. And there is nothing remotely casual about the way in which he seizes those opportunities. I recall standing last summer on the portico of the New York Public Library, on the night he lost the Perry Ellis emerging-designer award to Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez, of Proenza Schouler, who had gone outside for a smoke. The portico had the pleasant atmosphere of truancy. Marc Jacobs was there. So were Narciso Rodriguez and some models, everyone smoking as the evening rush rolled down Fifth Avenue. Eventually Posen appeared, with his mop of curls and heavy Charlie Chaplin brows, and he gave me a report on his shirt, which was in an eye-catching pattern. Usually designers, in social situations, avoid the topic of fashion, except to remark meanly about a person's dress. But my lingering sense was that Posen wanted me to know that he was not like the others. He had fashion on his brain all the time.", "abstract": "Interview with 23-year-old star designer Zac Posen; photos (special section, Fashions of The Times) (part 2 of 2-part section) (S)", "print_page": "66", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "A Little Bit Adorable"}, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "POSEN, ZAC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SPECIAL SECTIONS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "APPAREL"}], "pub_date": "2004-02-22T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Fashions of The Times Magazine", "section_name": "Style; Magazine", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Cathy", "rank": 1, "lastname": "Horyn"}], "original": "By Cathy Horyn"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd23c158eb7c8105d7d16ed", "word_count": 1517, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/22/business/business-people-tenants-provide-rent-and-ideas-for-filmmakers.html", "snippet": "In late March, Fisher Stevens and John Penotti, the founders of GreeneStreet Films, an independent production company that produced ''In the Bedroom,'' the 2002 Oscar nominee, will begin shooting a movie in New York, ''Romance and Cigarettes,'' th...", "lead_paragraph": "In late March, Fisher Stevens and John Penotti, the founders of GreeneStreet Films, an independent production company that produced ''In the Bedroom,'' the 2002 Oscar nominee, will begin shooting a movie in New York, ''Romance and Cigarettes,'' that stars Kate Winslet, Susan Sarandon and James Gandolfini.
