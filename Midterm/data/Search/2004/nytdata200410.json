She misses, and the statuette (perhaps Dame Julie's own, won for ''Mary Poppins,'' in 1965) smashes through a picture window in their Malibu beach house, apparently on its way to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. To date, that scene has been Mr. Edwards's closest brush with an Academy Award, apart from a 1983 nomination for his adapted screenplay for ''Victor/Victoria.''

A slight, wiry man, he plays outsize characters whose power derives from a sense of volumes left unspoken, emotions roiling beneath the surface, threatening to burst their restraints. That surface is as eloquent as the fin of a shark: it's what you don't see that matters most. But what if a part called for Mr. Kingsley to let passion rip? In ''House of Sand and Fog,'' it does, and the outcome is some of his best work. Mr. Kingsley plays Col. Massoud Behrani, an exiled, financially pressed Iranian military officer caught up in an escalating dispute over a modest Northern California bungalow. Behrani is an authoritarian paterfamilias capable of violence and proud of his former association with the Shah; yet he's also deeply principled, and his devotion to his family is the force that drives his life.

The picture seems more engineered than made, but almost single-handedly, Ms. Keaton saves it. Striding through the movie in leggy trousers and a series of dazzling white turtlenecks, she is not an aging sex symbol but an ageless one. For one thing, she's prettier than ever. Her skin has a fine luminosity (it's moon glow as opposed to sunshine), and the camera adores the planes of her face as well as its radiant, go-for-broke expressiveness. Ms. Keaton plays neurosis not as an endearing quirk but as an ostrich ballet, a series of unpredictable, flirtatious pirouettes and pli\u00e9s -- her grace is inexplicable and innate, and her line deliveries take death-defying loops and curves. When Harry, the 60-ish rake played by Jack Nicholson, calls Erica on the fact that she wears those turtlenecks even in summer, she asserts that she's simply always liked them -- even as she fiddles self-consciously with the fabric.
