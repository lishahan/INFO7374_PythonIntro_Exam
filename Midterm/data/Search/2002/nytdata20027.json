For the small publisher, no matter how eclectic, it's rather like being an elegant lightweight boxer doing speedy zigging and zagging in a ring with a heavyweight. Happily for readers and writers, there are enough of these gritty people with their determination to do some serious literary publishing that the giants won't. The Small Publishers Association of North America has more than 1,300 members, and there are more than that in the field. Many are niche operations.
