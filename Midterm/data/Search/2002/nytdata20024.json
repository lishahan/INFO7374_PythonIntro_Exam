Big, noisy and extremely hip, it will make traditionalists gnash their teeth. But at the Art Show, at the Seventh Regiment Armory, things are calm, quiet and tony. Displays by 70 dealers include 17th- and 18th-century artists like Rembrandt and Goya, and some contemporary artists like Jonathan Lasker. But the bulk of the show consists of paintings, sculptures and works on paper by textbook-certified Modernists and their acolytes, from Vuillard to Picasso and Pollock to Warhol.

These are among approximately 325 objects, many also lavished with gems set in pure gold that go on view on Sunday at the Cleveland Museum of Art. The exhibition, ''Treasury of the World: Jeweled Arts of India in the Age of the Mughals,'' harks back to 17th-century India. Organized by the al-Sabah Collection of the Kuwait National Museum, the display continues through May 19. For Eye and Ear The circus that comes to town at 8 tonight is definitely not your ordinary circus. Don't look for a big top or three rings. The performance takes place on the stage of City Center in Manhattan, and the attraction is Cirque \u00c9loize from Montreal. Cirque \u00c9loize belongs to the category of circuses called nouveau, but that's not all, because the show it is bringing to town for six performances through Sunday is ''Cirque Orchestra.'' Sharing the stage in this presentation of Lincoln Center's Great Performers New Visions series will be the Orchestra of St. Luke's, conducted by Miguel Harth-Bedoya. So, while performers like acrobats and trapeze artists engage in balletic feats and other gravity-defying flights of fancy, the orchestra will be playing the music of Tchaikovsky, Sibelius, Faur\u00e9, Rimsky-Korsakov, Saint-Sa\u00ebns and Moussorgsky.
