Academy voters take note. According to the tough British food writer Jane Grigson, Stargazy pie (sometimes spelled ''Stargazey'') is a Cornish creation traditionally made on Tom Bawcock's Eve, two days before Christmas, commemorating the night on which brave Bawcock went to sea to find sustenance for his foodless hometown of Mousehole. Against all odds he returned with netfuls of sardines, fed the town with this pie and wound up with a dish and an extremely minor holiday named after him. Asking where the townspeople found the bacon and hard-boiled eggs in the foodless burg is as irrelevant as questioning how the girl who married Cain got there.", "abstract": "Jonathan Reynolds cooking article on preparing sardine dishes, including Stargazy pie, Cornish creation; recipes; photo (M)", "print_page": "49", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Dinner and a Movie", "kicker": "FOOD"}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "COOKING AND COOKBOOKS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECIPES"}], "pub_date": "2002-02-24T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Magazine Desk", "section_name": "Magazine", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Jonathan", "rank": 1, "lastname": "Reynolds"}], "original": "By Jonathan Reynolds"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd219658eb7c8105d797680", "word_count": 1685, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/24/theater/spring-theater-six-decades-later-still-the-great-american-musical.html", "snippet": "HERE'S an ''Oklahoma!'' story: shortly before rehearsals began, one of the show's producers, Theresa Helburn, told the librettist Oscar Hammerstein II that he and the composer Richard Rodgers ought to write ''a song about the earth.''

Is this miniature poodle truly a more ideal specimen of its breed than that Kerry blue terrier? Is Russell Crowe's portrayal of the mathematician John Nash in ''A Beautiful Mind'' a ''powerful,'' Oscar-worthy performance or an irritating display of actorly ''mannerism''? There may be a preponderance of opinion on one side or the other of these questions, but each is fundamentally unanswerable -- which may explain why we just can't stop talking about them, especially when the official judgment conflicts with our own. Human beings have a yen for hierarchies; even if the most important aspects of our lives don't easily lend themselves to ranking, we feel compelled to try it anyway. Occasionally, deciding who's on top is easy enough: the New England Patriots indisputably if surprisingly won Super Bowl XXXVI, for example. Some contests, however, can be determined only through a process of subjective judging. For the empirically inclined, such competitions can be supremely irritating, but the popularity of figure skating, which dwarfs that of the Winter Olympics' more quantifiable events, suggests that these malcontents are in the minority.", "abstract": "Laura Miller article on contests and awards that can be determine only through process of subjective judging; cites public delight in complaining about collective expert judges; photo (M)", "print_page": "9", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Who's to Judge?", "kicker": "THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 2-24-02"}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "CONTESTS AND PRIZES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AWARDS, DECORATIONS AND HONORS"}], "pub_date": "2002-02-24T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Magazine Desk", "section_name": "Magazine", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Laura", "rank": 1, "lastname": "Miller"}], "original": "By Laura Miller"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd22ab58eb7c8105d7b5e9d", "word_count": 979, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/24/movies/film-a-portrait-of-the-artist-as-a-young-man-in-jail.html", "snippet": "BRENDAN BEHAN made his name twice, first as a writer and then as a character.

Raw talent cemented his status as the former; the bottle was a major factor in the latter. He is probably the only modern playwright to have regularly heckled his own plays.
