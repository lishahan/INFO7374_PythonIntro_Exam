Grief is reduced to a pantomime of denials and screams, of tears and silences. But a number of recent films -- several of them nominated for Academy Awards -- have taken a long look at the mourning that usually passes off-screen. And it might be a sign of the times that audiences have seemed drawn to movies about the loss of life. Grief is often portrayed in melodramatic scenes. The deserted go looking for the dead in empty rooms, searching their pockets, breathing in their unwashed clothes. But grief can cause even stranger behavior. In Todd Louiso's forthcoming ''Love Liza,'' Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a husband who can't bring himself to read the suicide note left by his wife; instead he devotes himself to sniffing gasoline. In Wes Anderson's ''Royal Tenenbaums,'' which was nominated for best original screenplay, Chas Tenenbaum (Ben Stiller) turns his grief over his wife's accidental death into a campaign against avoidable disaster. He is an amateur fire marshal and safety officer who tries to transform his powerlessness into endless plans of action. Chas doesn't stop to put his arms around his sons, and the movie doesn't let us really stop to contemplate his grief; it keeps us laughing with the absurd running joke of his voodoo dance against the inevitable. But the emotion beneath the odd comedy of his manner begins to creep up on you after a while.", "abstract": "Kristin Hohenadel article on number of recent films, several nominated for Academy Awards, that focus on mourning and grief, including Todd Louiso's forthcoming Love Liza, Todd Field's In the Bedroom and Marc Forster's Monster's Ball; photos (M)", "print_page": "25", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Film; Filmmakers Linger to Look at Death's Aftermath"}, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "LOVE LIZA (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "MONSTER'S BALL (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "IN THE BEDROOM (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "FIELD, TODD"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "LOUISO, TODD"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "FORSTER, MARC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "GRIEF (EMOTION)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}], "pub_date": "2002-02-24T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Arts and Leisure Desk", "section_name": "Movies; Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Kristin", "rank": 1, "lastname": "HOHENADEL"}], "original": "By KRISTIN HOHENADEL"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd2124d8eb7c8105d78882e", "word_count": 1707, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/24/theater/spring-theater-a-hollywood-maverick-but-also-a-broadway-baby.html", "snippet": "IN a rehearsal room eight floors above West 43rd Street, a wiry wisp of a gent is standing so close to the actors that you might mistake him for their dermatologist.

Accepted by Vassar College, she chose instead to seek an acting career, and following a fleeting appearance in summer stock, went to Hollywood and met her future husband. He was 36 years her senior, thrice divorced and a comic genius. When she turned 18, they married. Immediately, her father disowned and disinherited her. The marriage, however, endured; she had eight children, and remained with her husband for 34 years until his death in 1977.
