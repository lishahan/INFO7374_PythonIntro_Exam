There is also a Romanian-born man who swam the Danube as a boy to escape Communism and who became obsessed with painting flying saucers. The creations of these and others like them -- self-taught, intuitive, visionary -- will be on view from tomorrow through Sunday in the 10th anniversary Outsider Art Fair. This event, in the Puck Building in SoHo, brings together more than 1,000 works in all mediums. Ever Popular The songs include standards like ''Blues in the Night,'' ''That Old Devil Moon,'' ''The Lady Is a Tramp,'' ''Cheek to Cheek'' and ''Over the Rainbow.'' Among the songwriters are Johnny Mercer, Harold Arlen, Richard Rodgers, Oscar Hammerstein, Burton Lane, E. Y. Harburg and Irving Berlin, and the lineup of singers is an array of cabaret stars. One night won't hold them all. So the fourth season of Lincoln Center's American Songbook series will continue with three nights of entertainment, beginning with ''An Evening With Margaret Whiting, Hosted by Mary Cleere Haran'' at 8 tomorrow night in the Stanley H. Kaplan Penthouse in the Rose Building, 165 West 65th Street, between Amsterdam Avenue and Broadway. At 8 and 10 on Saturday night, Eric Comstock and Paula West will perform songs by Lane, and at 5 p.m. Sunday, Rob Kapilow will be joined by Ann Hampton Callaway in ''Say It With Music: The Art of the American Song.''", "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Footlights"}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2002-01-24T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "The Arts/Cultural Desk", "section_name": "Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "Lawrence", "middlename": "Van", "lastname": "GELDER", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd26da48eb7c8105d82719c", "word_count": 464, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/24/movies/arts-in-america-imitating-the-inimitable-hollywood-s-snippy-designer.html", "snippet": "The nature of filmmaking and all of American life has changed so completely since midcentury that there will probably never be a figure comparable to Edith Head.

The main goal of the event was to present four promising young singers, all recent winners of foundation awards, who are being sponsored in various recital appearances around the United States. The theme of the program, ''Vienna to Broadway,'' was the influence of 19th-century Viennese song on 20th-century American operetta and musical theater.
