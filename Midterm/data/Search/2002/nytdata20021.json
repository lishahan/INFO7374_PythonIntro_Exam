The film, set in the early 1940's, is a likable rites-of-passage memory piece doused in period nostalgia, including the prominent use of vintage Movietone newsreels to mark the events of World War II. While incarcerated in a Borstal (a British reform school), the teenage Brendan discovered the theater by reading Oscar Wilde, stood up to the institution's resident bully, tried and failed to escape, and formed two romantic relationships.

Nearly 100 of them are included in this wonderful show by one of the best museums in town. Among the highlights are exquisite iron ritual staffs, personable hand puppets, grave carved-wood maternity figures and a whole herd of the infinitely stylish, antelope-shaped crest masks known as Ci-wara.
