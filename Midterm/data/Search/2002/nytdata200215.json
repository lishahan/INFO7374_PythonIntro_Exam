In looking back to the savagery of the Hollywood blacklist in the late 1940's and 50's, when anti-Communist hysteria swept the country and many talented filmmakers were driven out of the industry, it's easy to forget the intensity of the paranoia and the viciousness of the persecution. The British director Karl Francis's film ''One of the Hollywood 10,'' which has its New York premiere on Sunday at the Walter Reade Theater, brings the era back in all its horror. The movie, a highlight of the 11th annual New York Jewish Film Festival, evokes a time of mob violence and sinister, goonlike government agents hounding suspected Communists day and night.

This 40-year-old museum finally has a home of its own and is celebrating its new quarters by showcasing two important recent gifts. The 400 objects of traditional folk art from Ralph Esmerian include extraordinary caches of portraits and needlework as well as walking sticks, painted furniture, frakturs, ceramics and weather vanes. Rife with acknowledged masterpieces, they raise the museum's collection to a new level while giving folk art itself a new visibility on the city's artscape. The Henry Darger gift, which includes 27 large two-sided watercolors and seven bound volumes by this Chicago recluse, counters the comforts of traditional folk art with a strong dose of the outsider variety, art made for an insatiable community of one. Reflecting the expanding folk-art field, the shows symbolize where the museum comes from and where it is going. Together they indicate that it intends to leave nothing behind. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, to 8 p.m. Admission: $9; $5, students and 62+ (Roberta Smith).", "abstract": null, "print_page": "46", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "ART GUIDE"}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2002-01-11T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Leisure/Weekend Desk", "section_name": "Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": null, "type_of_material": "Schedule", "_id": "4fd2195e8eb7c8105d79734b", "word_count": 4387, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/09/theater/sam-mendes-plans-to-leave-his-theater-post.html", "snippet": "After nearly a decade leading the Donmar Warehouse, the small London playhouse that helped make him a major cultural figure in Britain and abroad, Sam Mendes is preparing his goodbyes.
