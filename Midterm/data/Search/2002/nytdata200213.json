In one of his latest compositions, ''Lost Property,'' which appears on the Divine Comedy's new album, ''Regeneration,'' he recounts various items he has mislaid over the years. Passports, mobile phones, a pair of tennis rackets, sweaters, asthma inhalers, ''C-class narcotics'' -- the list is long and governed only by the laws of rhyme. Crooning in a rich baritone, Mr. Hannon expresses bewilderment at the way so many possessions have slipped from his grasp. But toward the song's end, he regains them all in a dream. ''I found them,'' he declares as the band builds to a climax, ''all piled up into the sky/ And I cried tears of joy.''
