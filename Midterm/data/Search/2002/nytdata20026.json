Until that film comes along, we'll have to endure ''John Q.,'' which will leave most audiences in dire need of medical attention, though it would be hard to say if that need will come from the painful collection of plot clich\u00e9s or Aaron Zigman's assaultive soundtrack. ''John Q.'' is a remarkable document, so ham-fisted that it sabotages its own worthwhile arguments. Denzel Washington, who just received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for his work in ''Training Day,'' finally does the kind of well-meaning everyman-fighting-the-power turn he's been accused of in the past. He's John Quincy Archibald -- yes, the film's title is literal -- a man who's struggling to keep his beleaguered family together.

But it won't take away your hunger for meat and potatoes. Subjectivity, atmosphere, the idea that ambience can be more powerful than blocks of solid matter: these are among the defining motifs in contemporary architecture and design. There is a need for an exhibition that explores these themes with analytic precision. ''Mood River'' doesn't satisfy that need. Rather, it is an extravagant demonstration in installation techniques, a window display of waves in search of depth. Organized by Jeffrey Kipnis and Annetta Massie, curators on the Wexner's staff, ''Mood River'' fills the entire museum.
