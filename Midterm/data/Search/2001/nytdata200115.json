Some years are defined by the famous figures whose passing unites the country and even the world. But this past year was perhaps more memorably defined by the passing of certain ideas: the eschatological promise of the Y2K bug, the supposed invincibility of the dot-com revolution, the limitless trajectory of Clinton-era prosperity, the pristine certainty of the electoral process. And the people whose stories united us were ones we'd never before heard of: the 17 victims of the U.S.S. Cole bombing; the 7 employees of Edgewater Technology, where Michael McDermott opened fire; the 118 sailors of the doomed Russian submarine, whose fading distress signals went unanswered as the world counted down their final days. In compiling this issue, we were drawn not necessarily to the best known or most accomplished, but to people whose stories represented an idea or embodied a moment. Many of the distinguished writers whose contributions follow had personal connections to their subjects. Lorrie Moore worked in the same department as Frederic Cassidy, the lexicographer, though she never got to know him. John le Carre had a longstanding friendship with Alec Guinness, who brought Smiley, the novelist's most famous character, to life. Oscar Hijuelos never forgot the day when, as a teenager, he saw Tito Puente perform. Sam Tanenhaus corresponded with Ella Goldberg Wolfe, the woman who grew up a Communist and died a Reaganite. And Michael Chabon was fascinated by Gene Kelly's younger brother because he was from Pittsburgh, a city to which Chabon paid tribute in his first novel. Most of us knew these people through their public profiles, if at all. But regardless of anyone's relationship to them, lives well lived provide rich fodder for all imaginations.", "abstract": "New York Times Magazine pays tribute to 28 people (and one horse) who died in 2000 whose lives made a difference; photo (M)", "print_page": "7", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "The Lives They Lived: 01-07-01"}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "DEATHS (OBITUARIES)"}], "pub_date": "2001-01-07T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Magazine Desk", "section_name": "Magazine", "subsection_name": null, "byline": null, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd2050e8eb7c8105d76ce67", "word_count": 310, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/07/nyregion/coping-i-lost-it-at-the-movies.html", "snippet": "IT was such a little request.
