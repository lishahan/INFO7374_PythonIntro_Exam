I can't say I was surprised. For 30 years, between 1927 and 1956, Crosby was a looming presence in America's cultural landscape. At the peak of his career, in the 1930's and 1940's, he was thought by many to be the most famous American alive. For much of that period, he was undoubtedly the most admired. The cycle of ''Road'' pictures with Bob Hope established Crosby as a great comic actor. Yet by the 1960's, the ocean began to roll over Der Bingle, and though he continued to sell millions of records -- chiefly holiday songs -- he had morphed into a grand old man while retaining little of the bite of his contemporary, Louis Armstrong, or his aging offspring, Frank Sinatra. Crosby's reputation faltered along with his music after his death, in 1977. When his eldest son, Gary Crosby, published a bitter memoir describing the unflappable Bing administering vigorous corporal punishment, his halo tilted and crashed. Soon the afterlife of his career imploded. Jazz lovers kept his memory alive, mainly because of his early records and the later collaborations with Armstrong, Louis Jordan, Les Paul and others. But jazz lovers are by nature classicists, and Crosby had spent most of his life on the other side of the divide: the pop world, where success is measured in numbers -- a world remade by rock, in which even the oldest of oldies postdate ''Heartbreak Hotel.'' Yet consider this: in 1946, three of the five top-grossing Hollywood pictures (''The Bells of St. Mary's,'' ''Blue Skies,'' ''Road to Utopia'') were Crosby vehicles; for five years running (1944 to 1948), he was No. 1 at the box office; his radio programs (1931 to 1962) attracted at their wartime peak as many as 50 million listeners; he recorded nearly 400 hit singles, an achievement no one -- not Sinatra, Elvis or the Beatles -- has come close to matching. Could a man who spoke so deeply to so many for so long have nothing to say to us now? For a biographer, Crosby's career offers more incentive than mere statistics. He is the ideal figure for tracking the rise of American popular culture. He played pivotal roles in the development of the recording, radio and film industries, while virtually defining the microphone as a singer's instrument. His influence on other singers -- including Sinatra, Elvis and John Lennon, avowed fans all -- would be hard to overstate, and he managed to maintain his popularity through several major cultural upheavals in 20th-century American history: Prohibition, Depression, World War II, the cold war and the affluent society.", "abstract": "Gary Giddins article offers appreciation of Bing Crosby; Giddens has written a biography, Bing Crosby: A Pocketful of Dreams--The Early Years, 1903-1940; photos (L)", "print_page": "1", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Bing Crosby, The Unsung King of Song", "kicker": "MUSIC"}, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "BING CROSBY (BOOK)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "CROSBY, BING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MUSIC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BOOKS AND LITERATURE"}], "pub_date": "2001-01-28T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Arts and Leisure Desk", "section_name": "Arts; Books", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Gary", "rank": 1, "lastname": "GIDDINS"}], "original": "By GARY GIDDINS"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd21d508eb7c8105d79e457", "word_count": 3287, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/28/books/and-bear-in-mind.html", "snippet": "(Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)    NOTES FROM THE HYENA'S BELLY: An Ethiopian Boyhood, by Nega Mezlekia.

PERFECT RECALL: New Stories, by Ann Beattie. (Scribner, $25.) Eleven sparkling stories from the prime student and expositor of the narcissistic, educated, white upper middle class on the East Coast and its complicated kinship structures. THE ABOMINATION, by Paul Golding. (Knopf, $26.) A smart, angry first novel full of beautiful surfaces, including that of the hero, if that's the word, who wanders through gay London seething with contempt for his milieu and hatred for the grown-ups who deformed his childhood. THE LECTURER'S TALE, by James Hynes. (Picador USA, $25.) A full-blown academico-Gothic farce, in which a self-effacing white male who loves books acquires the mysterious power to make people do whatever he wants; this faculty he employs against a Midwestern English department full of theorists and freaks. CONSTANTINE'S SWORD. The Church and the Jews: A History, by James Carroll. (Houghton Mifflin, $28.) Partly a Roman Catholic's memoir of a gradually arising moral reckoning in the 20th century, partly an examination of the relations between Christians and Jews, a central issue posed immediately in the first century and very often lamentably mishandled since then. IN SUNLIGHT, IN A BEAUTIFUL GARDEN, by Kathleen Cambor. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $23.) A sober, indeed stoical, novel, incorporating class conflict and observing the personal and emotional reticence of the 19th century, set in Johnstown, Pa., in the year a flood morally attributable to rich people upstream killed more than 2,000 of the less rich. INSPIRED SLEEP, by Robert Cohen. (Scribner, $25.) An elegant, witty novel whose protagonist is a struggling, 39-year-old single mother and adjunct professor whose gravest need is just a little sleep; she gets it, eventually, through involvement with a not particularly scrupulous experimental sleep laboratory. TRUE HISTORY OF THE KELLY GANG, by Peter Carey. (Knopf, $25.) An amazing act of historical impersonation in which the Victorian bandit Ned Kelly persuasively presents himself as a folk hero and Australian freedom fighter; by the author of ''Illywhacker'' and ''Oscar and Lucinda.'' THE ELEMENT OF LAVISHNESS: Letters of Sylvia Townsend Warner and William Maxwell, 1938-1978, edited by Michael Steinman. (Counterpoint, $27.50.)
