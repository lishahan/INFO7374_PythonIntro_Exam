Especially after her experience on the daytime drama ''As the World Turns.'' In 1985 Ms. Moore played the dual role of the good girl Frannie and her mysterious, identical, British half-sister Sabrina, who, in true soap fashion, was selfish and evil. Ms. Moore was so adept at making her characters' melodramatic existences plausible that in 1988 she was awarded a daytime Emmy, although she wasn't present at the ceremony to pick up her statuette. By then, she had left the show and was rehearsing the role of Ophelia in ''Hamlet'' at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis. As for the soap opera, the show carried on with the new Frannie and Sabrina, even though the characters looked nothing like Ms. Moore or, for that matter, each other. ''They hired two different actresses to replace me,'' Ms. Moore said. ''That was very, very flattering.''", "abstract": "Julianne Moore talks about getting lead role in movie Hannibal, to play character created by Jodie Foster in 1991 movie Silence of the Lambs; photo (M)", "print_page": "13", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Hello Again, Clarice, But You've Changed", "kicker": "FILM"}, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "HANNIBAL (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "FOSTER, JODIE"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "MOORE, JULIANNE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}], "pub_date": "2001-02-11T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Arts and Leisure Desk", "section_name": "Movies; Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Margy", "rank": 1, "lastname": "ROCHLIN"}], "original": "By MARGY ROCHLIN"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd21e5c8eb7c8105d7a054e", "word_count": 2082, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/11/books/a-long-way-from-tacoma.html", "snippet": "Bing Crosby   A Pocketful of Dreams.

Broadway *++ ''CONTACT.'' More than a year after opening, Susan Stroman's sparkling anthem to the transforming powers of dance has yet to succumb to the anemia that often befalls long-running musicals. A recent visit to this Tony Award-winning show found it in a robust, muscle-flexing state of health. This three-part self-described dance play has ripened into mellowness, with a newly relaxed expansiveness that doesn't dilute its intoxication factor. The attitude speaks of performers who are so comfortable with the contours of their parts that they can riff on them a bit, sounding new emotional notes. The original stars -- Karen Ziemba, Boyd Gaines and Deborah Yates -- are still on board and clearly delighted to be there, as is most of the original ensemble.

Now Playing * ''BEFORE NIGHT FALLS,'' starring Javier Bardem and Johnny Depp. Directed by Julian Schnabel (R, 125 minutes). Mr. Schnabel's romanticized portrait of the exiled gay Cuban poet and novelist Reinaldo Arenas, who committed suicide while suffering from AIDS, imagines pre-Castro Cuba as a pagan paradise of endless erotic promise ruined by the puritanical Communists, whom Arenas embraced, then turned against. Mr. Bardem's arresting performance paints Arenas as an emotionally volatile daredevil. But this biography, which incorporates swaths of Arenas's writing, is sketchy, and the star's thick Spanish accent is daunting. It's still quite indelible (Stephen Holden).", "abstract": null, "print_page": "21", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "MOVIE GUIDE"}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2001-02-09T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk", "section_name": "Movies; Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": null, "type_of_material": "Schedule", "_id": "4fd242c48eb7c8105d7dc304", "word_count": 2067, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/09/movies/classical-music-and-dance-guide.html", "snippet": "A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region.

Opera ''UN BALLO IN MASCHERA.'' Verdi's ''Ballo'' is an elegant opera, but this revival is blunt rather than elegant, like a lump of rock shot through with a few veins of gold. The Met has managed to find three genuine Verdi voices for the three main roles, but none of them sing with particular elegance or flair; the only real emotional impact comes from the Ulrica of Elena Zaremba. It doesn't help that the conductor, Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, seems to react to the score rather than leading it. The Oscar of Youngok Shin is something else again: a sprite on rubber legs cavorting around the stage, acting out her notes more than singing them, she seems descended from another planet.
