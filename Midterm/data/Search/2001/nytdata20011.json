The nominations were announced on Feb. 13, and everybody has had a chance to digest them, rate the competition and build a strategy. Over the next week the official ballots will go out to the 5,600 members of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences. If common wisdom holds true, the bulk of them will be filled out and returned to the academy within 10 days. So if filmmakers want to maneuver or make their case, either on behalf of their own films or to discredit a competitor, they will need to do it quickly. DreamWorks is building an energetic campaign for the Ridley Scott epic ''Gladiator,'' which received a dozen nominations, the most for any film this year.

Brown. Among Ms. Dunham's major contributions to American dance were her reconstructions and transformations of traditional African, Caribbean and American dance forms in theatrical programs in the 1940's. Her evident respect for and delight in those forms make it hard to believe -- as one commentator suggested in an excerpt shown from ''Free to Dance,'' a new documentary produced by the American Dance Festival -- that Ms. Dunham saw her presentations as dignifying the original dances. A half-century later Mr. Brown has imaginatively drawn on the forms in vibrant modern dance that have made him one of the most popular choreographers of his time. His new ''High Life'' blends traditional African, Latin jazz and street dance moves with modern dance in a series of stage-crosses that often look like simple struts. They are, however, a feast of complex counterpoint, patterning and sly, abrupt shifts from propulsive dance to loose walks and momentary dawdling pauses.", "abstract": "651 Arts Black Dance: Tradition and Transformation festival ends at BAM Harvey Theater with inspired combination of a tribute to Katherine Dunham with performance by Ronald K Brown; photo; Jennifer Dunning review (M)", "print_page": "1", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Take Tradition, Add Modernity and Make Life", "kicker": "DANCE REVIEW"}, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "BROWN, RONALD K"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "DUNHAM, KATHERINE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BLACKS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DANCING"}], "pub_date": "2001-02-27T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "The Arts/Cultural Desk", "section_name": "Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Jennifer", "rank": 1, "lastname": "DUNNING"}], "original": "By JENNIFER DUNNING"}, "type_of_material": "Review", "_id": "4fd22d688eb7c8105d7ba92f", "word_count": 587, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/26/business/most-wanted-drilling-down-movie-rentals-how-oscar-nominees-fare-on-tape-and-disc.html", "snippet": "Russell Crowe and Colosseum carnage (''Gladiator'') play equally well at the cinema and on the sofa.
