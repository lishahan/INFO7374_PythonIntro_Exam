Pollock, whose spontaneous paint pouring produced abstract masterpieces, was an emotionally fragile man whose drinking problem and mood swings were at odds with his creative drive. In New York City, where he went to study art in 1930, he found the stimulus his ambition demanded. As he began to achieve recognition, however, he was increasingly overwhelmed by the social and professional pressures of the art world. He mapped out his escape route in the summer of 1945 after a visit to the Springs, a rural hamlet on eastern Long Island outside the village of East Hampton. Bankrolled by a loan from his dealer and patron Peggy Guggenheim, he and his wife, the artist Lee Krasner, bought a modest homestead at 830 Fireplace Road, where they worked in relative isolation from the urban scene that Pollock described as brutal. But the couple never lacked visitors, and with the city only a three-hour train ride away, Pollock remained strongly connected to the network on which his career depended.", "abstract": "Article by Helen A Harrison, director of Pollock-Krasner House, describes filming of Pollock on site in Springs section of East Hampton, New York, where abstract expressionist painter and Lee Krasner settled in 1945; Ed Harris, who also directs, portrays Jackson Pollock; Marcia Gay Harden plays his wife; photos; map; visiting times for site noted; movie, shown briefly last year to qualify for Oscars, covers period from 1941 to Pollock's death in car crash in 1956 (M)", "print_page": "1", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Recreating Pollock, Gingerly"}, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "POLLOCK (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "POLLOCK, JACKSON"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "KRASNER, LEE"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "HARDEN, MARCIA GAY"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "EAST HAMPTON (NY)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ART"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}], "pub_date": "2001-02-16T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk", "section_name": "Movies; Travel; Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "Helen", "middlename": "A.", "lastname": "HARRISON", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By HELEN A.
