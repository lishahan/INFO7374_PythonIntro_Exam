She sat down with Harvey Weinstein, the larger-than-life power behind Miramax Films, whom she already knew was planning to produce the film, and told him how much she loved the part. ''I was kind of astonished by his reaction,'' Ms. Binoche recalled recently. ''He said, 'Well, Juliette, if you really want to do it, then you have to ask for it.' So I said, 'Harvey, may I do this film?' And it's funny, but it was a very good experience for me, because making a demand is very clarifying. I think in life you have to ask for things to happen.
