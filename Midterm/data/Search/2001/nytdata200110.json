The Danish director Gabriel Axel won a best foreign language film Oscar in 1988 for his wondrous adaptation of Isak Dinesen's marvelous short story, ''Babette's Feast,'' then disappeared off the cinematic radar. Oh, sure, Mr. Axel resurfaced in 1994 with ''Prince of Jutland,'' a three-hour epic based on the Danish Prince Amled, the real-life model for Shakespeare's Hamlet. But the director (who turns 83 this year) had fallen ill during editing and never completed post-production; the rough cut languished for several years, then was released on video by Miramax in 1999. Naturally, it was shorn of nearly half its length -- rendering threadbare even the credible performances of Helen Mirren, Gabriel Byrne and Christian Bale -- and blessed with a new score and a supposedly better title: ''Royal Deceit.''", "abstract": "Gabriel Axel's 1988 film Babette's Feast is issued in DVD; photo (M)", "print_page": "16", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Another Helping of 'Feast' (From a Lean Body of Work)", "kicker": "VIDEO"}, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "BABETTE'S FEAST (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECORDINGS (VIDEO)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}], "pub_date": "2001-01-28T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Arts and Leisure Desk", "section_name": "Movies; Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Kevin", "rank": 1, "lastname": "FILIPSKI"}], "original": "By KEVIN FILIPSKI"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd205138eb7c8105d76d261", "word_count": 557, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/27/sports/boxing-olympians-set-for-punchfest-at-the-garden.html", "snippet": "They are no longer teammates, but they still share the same goals.

Opera ''AIDA.'' Opera chat lines have been buzzing with talk that Luciano Pavarotti's five scheduled performances this month as Radames in Verdi's ''Aida'' at the Met could be his last with the company. It's not hard to understand why, judging from his first performance on Jan. 15. Mr. Pavarotti gets through the role, but just barely, and not without requiring the indulgence and attention of his vocal colleagues and, especially, of James Levine in the orchestra pit. There are still flashes of that Pavarotti sound, but it's sad to watch him struggle with phrases and lumber through the role. Deborah Voigt, who sings the title role splendidly, is making it her own. Olga Borodina is an ideal Amneris. And the baritone Mark Delavan, in his Met debut, is a vocally robust, intelligent and stylish Amonasro.
