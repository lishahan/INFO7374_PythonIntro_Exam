Ward's screen adaptation of the late John Steinbeck's novellas ''Cannery Row'' and ''Sweet Thursday,'' is the project from which Raquel Welch was sacked early in the production amid a lot of hard feelings. Miss Welch should send a large bouquet of roses to whoever is responsible. The only people who emerge from this precious nonsense smelling good are Richard MacDonald, the English production designer, and Sven Nykvist, the Swedish cameraman. Steinbeck, the 1962 Nobel laureate for literature and the author of more substantial works like ''The Grapes of Wrath'' and ''East of Eden,'' was not always in top form when he devoted himself to the celebration of the all-too-colorful wretches of Cannery Row. These are the softhearted bums, whores, shopkeepers and mental defectives who have dropped out of the American society of the mid-1940's to take up residence in the abandoned sardine canneries, shacks, boilers and pipes on the California coast near Monterey, which Steinbeck sometimes loved too well.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "10", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "THE FANCIFUL DROPOUTS ON 'CANNERY ROW'"}, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "CANNERY ROW (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}], "pub_date": "1982-02-12T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Weekend Desk", "section_name": "Movies; Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Vincent", "rank": 1, "lastname": "Canby"}], "original": "By Vincent Canby"}, "type_of_material": "Review", "_id": "4fd121308eb7c8105d5e2d1b", "word_count": 737, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/11/garden/new-york-city-honors-eight-of-its-own.html", "snippet": "IT was one of those rare occasions when well-known New Yorkers play second fiddle to the city's less-heralded citizens, and the result Tuesday night at the sixth annual New Yorker for New York Awards was a well-orchestrated evening of dinner, danc...", "lead_paragraph": "IT was one of those rare occasions when well-known New Yorkers play second fiddle to the city's less-heralded citizens, and the result Tuesday night at the sixth annual New Yorker for New York Awards was a well-orchestrated evening of dinner, dancing, speechmaking and camaraderie.

Unlike other major American novelists, Steinbeck had little to complain about in his relationship with Hollywood. If the movie version of his ''Tortilla Flat'' was respectable enough, both ''Of Mice and Men'' and ''The Grapes of Wrath'' were classics, nominated for Academy Awards as best picture, respectively, of 1939 and 1940, with John Ford winning the Oscar as best director for ''The Grapes of Wrath.''
