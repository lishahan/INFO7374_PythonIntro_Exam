When Mr. Tristano died of a heart attack at his home in Queens on Nov. 18, 1978, only one album of his work was in print, and it was on a Japanese label. Most critical accounts of the development of modern jazz in the 1940's and 1950's treated him as an interesting but minor footnote, more impressive as the mentor of first-rate improvisers l ike Lee Konitz and Warne Marsh than as a musician in hisown right. The reasons for Mr. Tristano's exclusion fr om so many jazz critics' pantheons are almost as interesting as the pianist's longneglected music. He has been taken to tas k for emphasizing melodic counterpoint and difficult, altered h armonies while bullying his drummers into functioning as self-effacin g human metronomes. The Dutch critic Martin Schouten has called the s ound of the pianist's bands ''pale'' and ''characterless'' and conc luded that Mr. Tristano's recordings betrayed a ''lack of fe eling for the role of 'sound' in jazz.''", "abstract": null, "print_page": "25", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "LENNIE TRISTANO- A NEGLECTED JAZZMAN"}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "MUSIC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "024-21-10"}], "pub_date": "1982-01-24T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Arts and Leisure Desk", "section_name": "Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Robert", "rank": 1, "lastname": "PALMER"}], "original": "By ROBERT PALMER"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd11c2d8eb7c8105d5d8a80", "word_count": 1355, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/22/movies/finney-and-miss-keaton-in-shoot-the-moon.html", "snippet": "''SHOOT THE MOON,'' written by the Oscar-winning Bo Goldman (''Melvin and Howard'' and ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'') and directed by Alan Parker (''Fame'' and ''Midnight Express''), is a bittersweet comedy about a marriage that has gone sma...", "lead_paragraph": "''SHOOT THE MOON,'' written by the Oscar-winning Bo Goldman (''Melvin and Howard'' and ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'') and directed by Alan Parker (''Fame'' and ''Midnight Express''), is a bittersweet comedy about a marriage that has gone smash before the film opens.

By Eva Hoffman He is a tall, robust man of 70 years with a sturdy face, dramatic blue eyes framed by prominent cheekbones and bushy, white eyebrows. He stands in a sparsely furnished apartment overlooking a snowy street in Cambridge, Mass., and he thinks back just a few days to the telephone call that brought the news of the military crackdown in Poland. As he speaks about this latest tragedy in his country, the poet and Nobel Laureate Czeslaw Milosz maintains his customary control, but the intensity of his feelings comes through. The precise, accented voice is grave and the eyes are charged w ith anger. ''Solidarity,'' he says, ''was a great hope for the whole world. Within the Soviet system an alternative was being worked out that was outside both Communism and capitalism.'' Then his expression changes, and the sadness turns to bitterness. ''Poles are known,'' he says, ''for trying the impossible. In World War II they attacked tanks with lances.

It was a bleak period of our history, a time, as he said, ''of soya beans and Basic English,'' and so he produced a book that saw the past in a roseate glow. The splendors of country-house life took on a glamour, and Oxford in the 1920's appeared to have a succulent decadence, which may never have been apparent at the time.

To optimists who have faith in the independence of the American consumer, these reports support their wildest dreams. To the rest of us, they are a little scary and, even after the fact, more than a little baffling. The season's biggest hits are not only the films that have been critically acclaimed or that have prompted serious controversy, like ''Reds'' or ''Pennies From Heaven,'' but also movies of such fecklessness that even their success can't teach us any special lessons. Take ''Modern Problems,'' the mildly amusing Chevy Chase film about a radioactive air traffic controller, a film with exactly four laughs in it, and ''Neighbors,'' John Avildsen's gross, clumsy adaptation of Thomas Berger's novel, starring John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd.
