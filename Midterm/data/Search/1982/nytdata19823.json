He walks with vigor but also with care. It's the sort of path on which one can easily slip, and a slip, when you're 80-odd years old, can be dangerous. An old woman briskly walks a path parallel to Donato's, just behind a hedge. At first Donato pays no attention. She calls to him to catch a rabbit that has escaped her. He stops, contemplates the rabbit in the middle of the path, in the same way that the rabbit contemplates him. After a brief scramble, he succeeds in grabbing the rabbit, which he hands over to the woman. ''I was going to cook it for your supper,'' the woman says, smiling. Then she bends over and sets the rabbit free.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "8", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "'THREE BROTHERS,' ITALY'S OSCAR NOMINEE"}, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "THREE BROTHERS (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}], "pub_date": "1982-02-19T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Weekend Desk", "section_name": "Movies; Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Vincent", "rank": 1, "lastname": "CANBY"}], "original": "By VINCENT CANBY"}, "type_of_material": "Review", "_id": "4fd11e328eb7c8105d5dccea", "word_count": 1167, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/18/obituaries/lee-strasberg-of-actors-studio-dead.html", "snippet": "Lee Strasberg, father of ''Method acting'' in America, artistic director of the Actors Studio, stage director, film actor and a major figure in world theater, died of a heart attack yesterday.

The Method, a system of vocal, physical and emotional exercises, was initiated in Russia by Constantin Stanislavsky; it encouraged the actor to use his psyche and subconscious in preparing for a role.
