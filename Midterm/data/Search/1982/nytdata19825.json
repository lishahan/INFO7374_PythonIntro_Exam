Outside, darkness began to cover the view of St. Patrick's Cathedral to the south and Rockefeller Center to the west. A hectic day was nearing an end. So, his head was back, his collar and tie hung loose and his feet rolled lazily atop his slightly cluttered desk. There was reason for O'Brien's cheerful mood early last week. For, despite the f act that seven of the National B asketball Association's 23 teams were presently registering decreases in fan attendance from last season, the league-wide figure was up al most 10 percent, with nine teams showing increases of more than 1,1 00 fans a game. Also, the league recently signed a new network tele vision contract with theColumbia Broadcasting System, which reportedl y calls for the teams todivide a total of $88 million in rights fees over four years. That represents an increase of about $14 million o ver the previous payout.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "N.B.A. THINKS ABOUT CHANGES"}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "PROFESSIO"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AL SPORTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BASKETBALL"}], "pub_date": "1982-01-31T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Sports Desk", "section_name": "Sports", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "Roy", "middlename": "S.", "lastname": "JOHNSON", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By ROY S.

The Agriculture Department has sometimes sided with the consumers in the dispute and sometimes with the producers. Ground bone is a byproduct - invisible to the naked eye -that results when scraps of meat are removed from beef and hog carcasses by machine. Under the current Agriculture Department regulation, ground-up bone, mixed with scraps of ground-up meat, can replace up to 20 percent of the meat in hot dogs, bologna, liverwurst and a host of other processed meats, including canned chili con carne and spaghetti with meat sauce.
