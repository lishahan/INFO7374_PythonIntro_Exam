Jazz-fusion, pop-soul and African- and West Indian-flavored material vied for pre-eminence in a repertory that was as scattered as it was ambitious. Since then, Ms. Reeves's focus hasn't narrowed appreciably, but she has developed the confidence and vision to put a personal stamp on her material by making connections between far-flung styles and paying close attention to lyrics. Her remarkable voice has also gained in strength and flexibility. Among the handful of younger jazz singers who aspire to carry forward the great tradition of Sarah Vaughan and Ella Fitzgerald, Ms. Reeves is as well equipped as anybody to carry the torch. She has a clear, powerful contralto that she wields with a leonine confidence, bending, soaring and growling but rarely exploiting her virtuosity for mere display.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "17", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Review/Pop; Dianne Reeves's Flavorings"}, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "REEVES, DIANNE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MUSIC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "JAZZ"}], "pub_date": "1992-02-18T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Cultural Desk", "section_name": "Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Stephen", "rank": 1, "lastname": "HOLDEN"}], "original": "By STEPHEN HOLDEN"}, "type_of_material": "Review", "_id": "4fd1b1f58eb7c8105d6d484b", "word_count": 279, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/17/arts/critic-s-notebook-dr-freud-can-tea-really-just-be-tea.html", "snippet": "At a recent seminar on Schubert at the 92d Street Y, a professor at the University of Minnesota, Susan McClary, examined the composer's \"Unfinished\" Symphony as possibly reflecting his personal, social and even sensual thoughts.
