It may be as simple as a tip on how to prepare grits. (Fannie Flagg's \"Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe\" comes with recipes, along with the news that grits keep you regular.) Or perhaps it's the fact that most of the story (i.e., the first three-quarters of Susan Isaacs's \"Shining Through,\" or the second half of Oscar Hijuelos's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel \"The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love\") never made it to the screen. It could even be the odd fact that a book (Meg Wolitzer's \"This Is Your Life\") en route to the movies (Nora Ephron's \"This Is My Life\") got a slightly different name. Going back to the source material is a fine way of second-guessing why film makers did what they did and what they should have done instead. Whatever the literary merits of comparing a book with its screen adaptation, it does make for an irresistible sideline.

A1 RULING IN IRISH ABORTION CASE The Irish Supreme Court overturned a lower-court ruling and cleared the way for a 14-year-old girl to go to Britain for an abortion. The girl, who says she was raped, had been barred from leaving because of Ireland's own law restricting abortions. A1 AUTO MAKERS' TWO WORLDS When Chrysler's chairman visited Japan with President Bush, he made no mention of the Nagoya plant where Mitsubishi makes the Dodge Stealth. But \"American\" cars keep pouring off Japanese assembly lines, underscoring the Big Three's dependence on Japanese factories. A1 BENDING RULE ON SOMALI AID The threat of starvation around Somalia's embattled capital is so serious that the United Nations is considering breaking its normal rules and giving food to armed combatants as well as civilians. A3 SPECTATORS IN SOUTH AFRICA Conversations in South Africa's biggest black township confirm a painful paradox: to get a fresh mandate to negotiate power-sharing with the black majority, President de Klerk has turned to the white minority that elected him. A3 GUATEMALA ENTRENCHED IN WAR Despite hopes that peace in El Salvador might spur an end to the civil war in Guatemala, recent negotiations have shown that its rightist Government and leftist guerrillas are taking their own time. A6 COLOMBIA ARMY QUITS DRUG WAR In a shift in strategy, the United States and Colombia have agreed that Colombia's army will no longer play a big role in pursuing cocaine traffickers, officials said. U.S. aid will be redirected to the police. A6 HOLES IN HAITIAN ACCORD After signing an accord to end Haiti's political crisis, leaders disagree on whether it calls for the punishment of the army commander who led a military coup last year. A8 U.S. MAY BACK ELEPHANT HUNTING A week before a world meeting on endangered species, the Bush Administration said it was sympathetic to a proposal by some African nations to open international trading in elephant hides and meat. A11 Armenians overrun Azerbaijanis in a disputed enclave. A5 Moscow Journal: On a Big Mac, a genuine Russian pickle. A4 Canada wants to pull combat forces out of Europe by the end of 1994. A9 National A12-23 SEX DISCRIMINATION RULING In a broad, unanimous decision, the Supreme Court said the Federal law barring sex discrimination in schools and colleges permits students to sue for damages for sexual harassment and other forms of sex discrimination. A1 LOOKING LIKE A LONG CAMPAIGN News analysis: Voters in four states have now had their say about whom the Democrats should nominate to oppose President Bush, and the outcome at the convention is no clearer than it was before the balloting. A1 TOUGH TALK FROM KERREY Seeking votes in conservative Georgia, Senator Kerrey and his supporters bluntly criticized Governor Clinton for avoiding military service in Vietnam, and for the first time, former Senator Tsongas obliquely raised the issue as well. A22 Polling in South Dakota reveals problems for the candidates. A22 Maryland appears to be ideal Tsongas country. A23 Washington and Idaho are eager for the Democrats to come West. A23 END FOR A NUCLEAR PLANT The nation's oldest nuclear power plant will be closed immediately, ending the industry's hopes that the plant would be allowed to prove that nuclear plants could operate safely for up to 60 years. A12 HOME ON THE RANGE Ault Journal: Buffeted by hard times, ranchers are getting fewer and older, but for those who remain it's still a life where miracles master misery. A12 COMMON DRUGS AND SAFETY Possibly dangerous side-effects of some over-the-counter drugs are going unreported, a Government study said, because the Food and Drug Administration's system of approving and monitoring those drugs is inadequate. A12 A TREATMENT BACKFIRES In a finding with major implications for people with multiple sclerosis, doctors reported that the standard treatment for a painful eye disease closely related to m.s. may actually worsen the disease. A14 U.S. SHIFT ON WARMING The Bush Administration is to announce plans to help developing countries pay for limiting the emission of gases that cause global warming. A14 TAKING AIM AT COMMISSIONER Saying the Commissioner of Food and Drugs is biased on the issue, a leader of plastic surgeons began a campaign to bar him from making the decision on whether silicone gel breast implants are safe. A20 Fewer unmarried white women are putting their babies up for adotpion. A15 A teen-ager whose arms were reattached goes home. A20 Texas has been unable to verify an AIDS cluster in a small town. A20 Metropolitan Digest, B1 GAMBINO PLEA DEAL MADE Two sons of the late crime boss Carlo Gambino and others allied with them agreed yesterday to quit the trucking business and pay a $12 million fine in exchange for being spared prison sentences. Prosecutors said that the plea bargain would break organized crime's half-century stranglehold on New York City's dwindling garment industry.
