But for a moment Mr. Puente, known as El Rey (The King) of Latin music, is within reach of New Yorkers, playing tomorrow at Madison Square Garden. It's a special occasion: Mr. Puente will be celebrating the release of his 100th album, with a huge cast paying tribute, including the great singer Celia Cruz and the band leaders Oscar D'Leon, Tito Nieves, Ismael Miranda and Jose (El Canario) Alberto. It's a chance to catch one of the great figures in American music. At 68 years old, Mr. Puente is an extraordinarily vital performer and improviser. When he plays, he's a mess. He'll whap away at his timbales, elbows flying up around his head, his hair waving around, eyes wide. He mugs: dancing around, fooling with guests onstage. He's the jovial host, inviting the audience to enjoy itself. It's no accident that Bill Cosby shows up at most of his New York concerts, ready to climb onstage to clown around with him.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "3", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Tito Puente Celebrates 100 Albums"}, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "PUENTE, TITO"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MUSIC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CONCERTS AND RECITALS"}], "pub_date": "1992-02-14T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Weekend Desk", "section_name": "Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Peter", "rank": 1, "lastname": "WATROUS"}], "original": "By PETER WATROUS"}, "type_of_material": "Biography", "_id": "4fd19ee18eb7c8105d6b21a6", "word_count": 1090, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/13/movies/home-video-324292.html", "snippet": "In video stores there are A movies and B movies.
