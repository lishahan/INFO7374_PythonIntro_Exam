The comedy wasn't great when it was called ''One Wild Moment,'' but it's far more offputting as ''Blame It on Rio,'' directed by Stanley Donen, with a cast headed by Michael Caine, Joseph Bologna and Valerie Harper, and a screenplay by Charlie Peters and Larry Gelbart. As before, the story is about a middle-aged man (Mr. Caine), who is seduced by the beautiful teen-age daughter of his best friend (Mr. Bologna) during a month's holiday by the sea.

But Mr. Korolenko, in assembling this portrait of the late singer-songwriter Phil Ochs, has taken an exasperating approach to his subject. Reasonable as it would be to expect the music and photographs of the real Mr. Ochs to figure prominently in this documentary, Mr. Korolenko has replaced him with a double. All the other key characters in this story appear as themselves. In ''Chords of Fame,'' which opens today at the Film Forum, the very caustic and intense Mr. Ochs is portrayed by Bill Burnett, who is so callow and bland in the role that he captures nothing of his mercurial subject. Mr. Burnett's slight vocal resemblance to the singer is no justification for the lengthy impersonation on which the film is centered. In trying to progress from a furiously energetic, wisecracking young man to the dissipated and discouraged figure who eventually took his own life, his range is pitifully limited. To suggest Mr. Ochs in his hard-drinking later days, for instance, Mr. Burnett preserves his own clean-cut manner but staggers around in a raincoat with a large stain.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "23", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "FILM: PHIL OCHS, A SHORT BIOGRAPHY"}, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "CHORDS OF FAME (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}], "pub_date": "1984-02-16T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Cultural Desk", "section_name": "Movies; Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Janet", "rank": 1, "lastname": "MASLIN"}], "original": "By JANET MASLIN"}, "type_of_material": "Review", "_id": "4fd149f98eb7c8105d62706a", "word_count": 696, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/14/books/books-of-the-times-244326.html", "snippet": "THE SELECTED ESSAYS OF CYRIL CONNOLLY.

Before accepting the conventional wisdom that Mr. Reagan is unbeatable, political prophets should consider strong evidence that the President is worse off with the electorate - and women particularly - than he was four years ago. Rather than just another special-interest group, women are the biggest eligible voting group in the nation (53 percent); in 1980, six million more women than men voted, and in 1984 they may outnumber male voters by more than nine million. Last year, Mr. Reagan's campaign director, Edward J. Rollins, warned that ''the political party that gets the women's vote will be the majority party, while the party of men will be the minority.'' Mr. Reagan received only 21 million votes from women in 1980, while Jimmy Carter and John B. Anderson got 25 million. In the last three years, President Reagan has so successfuly alienated millions of women from all walks of life that he will most likely get an even lower total in 1984. The President is threatened not only by intensive voter registration drives by major organizations of women, blacks, minorities and labor but also by the loss of significant support from two female groups that were among his mainstay in 1980: Republican women and older women. In 1980, when there was an 8 percent gender gap between Republican men and women voters, 13 percent of the women defected; last June, a New York Times/CBS News Poll showed a startling 24 percent gender gap on the question of whether Mr. Reagan deserves another term.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "19", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "WOMEN VS.
