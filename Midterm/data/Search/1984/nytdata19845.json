The panels, which have been in crates in the belfry of the North Baptist Church of Port Chester since it opened its current building in 1924, form part of a window 13 feet high and 5 feet wide that depicts Christ walking on water. Another window, actually a triptych of John baptizing Christ, is installed above the church's baptistery and is displayed through photographs at the Neuberger Museum. The stained-glass windows show the creative and technical brilliance of the 19th-century glass maker, who was responsible for many innovations in his field, according to Carolyn Owsianik, the exhibition's curator. Both sets of windows were created during the 1890's for the Epiphany Baptist Church in midtown Manhattan, which was razed in 1922. They were removed from the Manhattan church when its congregation relocated in 1906 and were forgotten until they appeared in Westchester in the 1920's.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "20", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "TIFFANY SHOW OPENING AT NEUBERGER"}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "TERMS NOT AVAILABLE"}], "pub_date": "1984-02-05T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Westchester Weekly Desk", "section_name": "New York and Region", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "Ian", "middlename": "T.", "lastname": "MACAULEY", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By IAN T.
