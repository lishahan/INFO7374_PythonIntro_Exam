Mr. Forsyth agreed. ''It's a very sad film,'' he said, laughing heartily. This is quite a departure for the shy, 36-year old Scot who wrote and directed ''Gregory's Girl'' and ''Local Hero,'' and whose first ''wee film,'' ''That Sinking Feeling,'' opens at the Lincoln Plaza on Wednesday. He recently finished shooting his fourth and latest movie, ''Comfort and Joy,'' scheduled to arrive in New York late next fall. Why the agent and the filmmaker should have been thankful that the latest Forsyth effort has its sad side is a bit of a mystery. Because Bill Forsyth, all by himself, has put Scotland on the map of the world for his funny movies. ''Gregory's Girl'' won the British Academy Award for best original screenplay, beating out the British-made ''Chariots of Fire,'' which had won an American Oscar. Both ''Gregory's Girl'' - which critics called ''irresistible,'' among other things - and ''Local Hero'' have piled up praises and millions of dollars at box offices across the United States. They proved equally popular in Britain.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "19", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "BILL FORSYTH TAKES A LOOK BACK IN LAUGHTER"}, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "THAT SINKING FEELING (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "FORSYTH, BILL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}], "pub_date": "1984-02-12T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Arts and Leisure Desk", "section_name": "Movies; Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Nan", "rank": 1, "lastname": "ROBERTSON"}], "original": "By NAN ROBERTSON"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd133298eb7c8105d602228", "word_count": 1541, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/11/world/around-the-world-guatemala-s-opposition-criticizes-high-official.html", "snippet": "Guatemalan opposition leaders are calling for the resignation of Interior Minister Gustavo Adolfo Lopez Sandoval, saying he has been unable to halt a recent surge in political violence.
