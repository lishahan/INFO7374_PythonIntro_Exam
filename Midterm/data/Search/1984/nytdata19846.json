The Anglo- Irish list of great writers ranges, just to mention a few of the more outstanding examples, from Jonathan Swift to Richard Brinsley Sheridan to Oscar Wilde. Oddly enough, the confrontation of the two cultures, long saturated in tragedy, has produced a rather startling amount of comedy. A Sean O'Casey might excel in the tricky genre of tragicomedy, but other writers, those like Honor Tracy, have developed a humorous style of a wickedly clever sort. In this latter category are two somewhat eccentric cousins, Edith Somerville and Violet Florence Martin, whose nom de plume was Martin Ross. The two began collaborating on literary ventures in the final decades of the last century. One of their works, ''Some Experiences of an Irish R. M.,'' has been adapted for television by a consortium of British and Irish organizations and, beginning tonight at 9 on WNET/Channel 13, will be running on public television's ''Masterpiece Theater'' for the next six weeks.
