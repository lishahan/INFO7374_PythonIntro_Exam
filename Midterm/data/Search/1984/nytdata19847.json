The only part of the game that caught his eye was Marcus Allen's 74-yard romp for a touchdown. As a track sprinter who enjoys the feeling of running ahead of the pack, Walker appreciated Allen's jaunt through the Washington Redskins.

How she did this is one of the surprises Miss Tharp and her dance company, which opened at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, provided with two very different premieres and a staple, ''Sue's Leg.'' In a way, this first of three programs offered a mini-retrospective of Miss Tharp's dance concerns. While not complete and not reaching back to her choreographic beginnings in the 1960's, it showed a wider range than usual for a Tharp program. One reason behind the variety would seem to be Miss Tharp's own evolution, her shift toward styles and esthetics that are new to her if not necessarily new to others.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "24", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "DANCE: 2 PREMIERES BY TWYLA THARP IN BROOKLYN"}, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "THARP, TWYLA, DANCE COMPANY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DANCING"}], "pub_date": "1984-01-25T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Cultural Desk", "section_name": "Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Anna", "rank": 1, "lastname": "KISSELGOFF"}], "original": "By ANNA KISSELGOFF"}, "type_of_material": "Review", "_id": "4fd149fa8eb7c8105d627103", "word_count": 696, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/22/books/noted-with-pleasure.html", "snippet": "Some passages from current and recently published books that we find particularly appealing.

Primal Scream Even if Elizabeth Bishop had never written a line of poetry, her ''Collected Prose'' (Farrar, Straus & Giroux) would be enough to give her a lasting reputation. One of her great gifts was an ability to convey with singular purity both the terror and the wonder of childhood, particularly when writing about the Nova Scotia village where she spent her early years. A scream, the echo of a scream, hangs over that Nova Scotian village. No one hears it; it hangs there forever, a slight stain in those pure blue skies, skies that travelers compare to those of Switzerland, too dark, too blue, so that they seem to keep on darkening a little more around the horizon - or is it around the rims of the eyes? - the color of the cloud of bloom on the elm trees, the violet on the fields of oats; something darkening over the woods and waters as well as the sky. The scream hangs like that, unheard, in memory - in the past, in the present, and those years between. It was not even loud to begin with, perhaps. It just came there to live, forever - not aloud, just alive forever. Its pitch would be the pitch of my village. Flick the lightning rod on top of the church steeple with your fingernail and you will hear it.

ROMAN By Roman Polanski. Illustrated. 461 pp. New York: William Morrow & Co. $17.95. By Thomas Keneally THE idea of writing a history of his life came to Roman Polanski when in 1981 he was visiting the Polish village of Wysoka. There as a child he had found refuge from the Nazis with the family of an impoverished farmer, during the period between the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto in March 1943 and the parlous liberation of Poland by the Russians at the end of World War II. Most Polish patriots see a parallel between the episodes of their own lives and the tragic phases of their country's history, and Mr. Polanski says he was further encouraged to tell his story, the story of a Polish traveler in a large and dangerous world, by the imposition of martial law in Poland late in 1981.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "3", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "FROM HOLOCAUST TO HOLLYWOOD"}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "TERMS NOT AVAILABLE"}], "pub_date": "1984-01-22T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Book Review Desk", "section_name": "Arts; Books", "subsection_name": null, "byline": null, "type_of_material": "Review", "_id": "4fd12ffc8eb7c8105d5fc8da", "word_count": 2442, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/22/arts/faerie-tale-home-video-classics-on-cassettes-fairy-tales-chekhovand-a-chiller.html", "snippet": "''The Tale of the Frog Prince''; ''Sleeping Beauty''; ''Goldilocks and the Three Bears''; ''Jack and the Beanstalk''; ''Rapunzel.''
