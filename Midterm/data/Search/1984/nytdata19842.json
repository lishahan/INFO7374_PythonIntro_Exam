Warren also produces high-quality wool, cotton and felt, but its chief stock in trade is the fine fabric purchased by such clients as designers Bill Blass, Oscar de la Renta, Stanley Blacker, and top-of-the-line companies such as Hart, Shaffner & Marks, Palm Beach and the American division of Christian Dior.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "21", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "MILL TOWN HAS STAKE IN 2 WORLDS"}, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "ANDERER, JOSEPH"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "STAFFORD SPRINGS (CONN)"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "WARREN OF STAFFORD"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TEXTILES"}], "pub_date": "1984-02-19T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Connecticut Weekly Desk", "section_name": "New York and Region", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Diane", "rank": 1, "lastname": "COX"}], "original": "By DIANE COX"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd140e28eb7c8105d618c5c", "word_count": 1245, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/19/arts/film-view-a-great-cameraman-weaves-an-epic-spell.html", "snippet": "A fter one has watched movies for a living over a period of years, the surprises become increasingly rare.

The major surprises in the nominations announced by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences included the spurning of two big-star performances and the nominating of several specialized low-budget movies - all costing less than $5 million and most less than $4 million - for two or more major awards. The low- budget films include ''Reuben, Reuben,'' ''Tender Mercies,'' ''Fanny and Alexander,'' ''Educating Rita,'' and, in particular, ''The Dresser.'' In addition to a nomination for best picture, ''The Dresser'' - which tells the story of the last days of an aging English actor and his relationship with the man who runs his backstage life - received nominations for its two leading actors, Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay; for its screenplay, and, in perhaps the day's biggest surprise, for its director, Peter Yates. ''The Dresser'' was joined in the race for best picture by ''The Big Chill,'' a comedy about seven college friends coming to terms with death and the compromises of adulthood; ''The Right Stuff,'' the story of the first seven American astronauts and the legendary test pilot who preceded them; ''Tender Mercies,'' the redemption of a country-western singer, and ''Terms of Endearment.''
