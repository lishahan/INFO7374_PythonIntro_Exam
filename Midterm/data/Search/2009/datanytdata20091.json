(Starz) REDBELT (2008) In this fight film written and directed by David Mamet, a Los Angeles jujitsu instructor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) with money troubles saves a pampered, slumming action star (Tim Allen, above right) from a beating. After which promises of friendship ensue, and principles are surrendered. Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis said Mr. Mamet had ''taken a sturdy B-movie conceit -- a good man versus the bad world, plus blood -- tricked it out with his rhythms, his corrosive words and misanthropy, and come up with a satisfying, unexpectedly involving B movie that owes as much to old Hollywood as to Greek tragedy.'' 6:30 P.M.

Name: JBM Vintage File Under: Vintage Showrooms, New York, By AppointmentAddress: 11 East 75th Street, New York NY 10021Telephone Number: (212) 585-3555Web site: JBMvintage.comWhat To Get: These days, spending a lot of money so we can dress up makes us feel like we deserve a serious dressing down. Enter JBM, a high-end vintage salon for fashion plates who like their designer duds served with a side of fiscal restraint. Co-owners Jennifer Bandier and Lori Margolis have been collecting vintage fashion for decades, so the selection is vast and tantalizing. You'll find confections by Dior, Chanel, Halston, Oscar, Pucci and Gucci -- all way below what you'd pay retail. And if it's a one night stand you're looking for, you can rent a cocktail dress or gown for $150.What I Lust For: I longingly eyed a spectacular jeweled Pucci gown -- that is until the girls told me they're waiting for a museum curator to price it. Gulp. Instead, I'll opt for a chic, beige, knit Pierre Cardin dress with gold buttons ($350), a cute, round leather and metal Dior purse ($500) and a YSL pussy bow silk blouse ($400). Just when I thought it was safe to leave, on my way out the door I spied a fantastic necklace with huge orange and blue stones for $550. So much for fiscal restraint.Atmosphere: Located in a swanky Upper East Side townhouse between Park and Madison, the showroom has old-worldy touches that compliment the clothes, including pretty moldings, a fireplace and an old black glass chandelier Bandier found at a New Mexico flea market while visiting a vintage Dior vendor.", "print_page": null, "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Sandra's Sources | JBM Vintage", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "keywords": [{"rank": "1", "name": "type_of_material", "value": "News"}], "pub_date": "2009-02-27T12:34:42Z", "document_type": "blogpost", "news_desk": null, "section_name": "T:Style", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Sandra", "rank": 1, "lastname": "BALLENTINE"}], "original": "By SANDRA BALLENTINE"}, "type_of_material": "Blog", "_id": "4fd394098eb7c8105d8c87a0", "word_count": 317, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800E7D71E3DF934A15751C0A96F9C8B63", "snippet": "CLASSICAL     Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music....", "lead_paragraph": "CLASSICAL Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "20", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "The Listings"}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2009-02-27T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk", "section_name": "Movies; Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"organization": "THE NEW YORK TIMES", "original": "By THE NEW YORK TIMES", "person": []}, "type_of_material": "Schedule", "_id": "4fd299048eb7c8105d876a31", "word_count": 2136, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DEEDA153EF934A15751C0A96F9C8B63", "snippet": "FOR CHILDREN     BAMKIDS FILM FESTIVAL (Saturday and Sunday) Just when you thought the movie awards were over, here come the BAMmies.
