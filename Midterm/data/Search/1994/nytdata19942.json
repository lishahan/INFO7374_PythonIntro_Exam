Rarely has a pop song been better used as a musical accent on film, as Nilsson's sweet, soaring vocal conveys the fragile optimism of Joe Buck, the story's self-styled stud. The music buoyantly follows Joe to New York City as he dreams of his bright future as a gigolo. But as the film spirals downward, from high hopes to seedy realities and from Park Avenue to 42d Street, it delivers a stark cross section of Joe's brutalizing new world. Slapped with an X rating when it opened in 1969, \"Midnight Cowboy\" was controversial in its day. That X was later scaled down to an R after the film won three Academy Awards, including the Oscar for best picture. (\"Midnight Cowboy\" is now being reissued for a 25th-anniversary engagement in New York and Los Angeles.
