Previously, both the Los Angeles Film Critics Association and the New York Film Critics Circle had chosen Mr. Spielberg's three-hour film of the Holocaust for the top award, but presented the best-director citation to Jane Campion for \"The Piano\" rather than Mr. Spielberg. The critics' votes are often considered bellwethers of the annual presentation of the Academy Awards, which will be made this year on March 21. Although Mr. Spielberg, 46, is commercially the most successful director in movie history, he has never won an Oscar. In 1987, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presented him with the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial award, in recognition of his collective body of work.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "18", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Critics Name Spielberg Best Director"}, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "SCHINDLER'S LIST (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "SPIELBERG, STEVEN"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NATIONAL SOCIETY OF FILM CRITICS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AWARDS, DECORATIONS AND HONORS"}], "pub_date": "1994-01-04T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Cultural Desk", "section_name": "Movies; Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Glenn", "rank": 1, "lastname": "COLLINS"}], "original": "By GLENN COLLINS"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd1eadf8eb7c8105d73acc9", "word_count": 300, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/04/style/for-carolina-herrera-tranquillity-amid-success.html", "snippet": "In no way does she resemble a garmento (fashion-business jargon for a designer/ manufacturer of clothes, usually with headquarters on Seventh Avenue).

Everyone from President Clinton to the nation's movie critics has called it a masterpiece, with some enthusiasts pointedly reassuring readers that, at 3 hours 5 minutes, the film is not a moment too long. \"Schindler's List\" is the culture's new Messiah: the antidote to the terrifying 1993 Roper Organization poll in which 22 percent of the American public expressed doubt that the Nazi extermination of the Jews actually happened.
