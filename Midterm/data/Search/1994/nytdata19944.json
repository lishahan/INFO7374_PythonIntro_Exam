Yes, he says, the film, which opens on Friday, shows a brother and a sister making love. But, says the 48-year-old director, who also wrote the screenplay, \"The Cement Garden\" is actually more about \"freedom,\" \"making connections\" and \"trying to escape from formal systems.\" Not that the lanky, long-haired Mr. Birkin is one to deny the lure of incest. \"In any relationship,\" he says, \"it's love that matters. So, in this particular story, I don't see anything immoral about it.
