That is, until a prostitute runs screaming in front of their car, thrusting her bloody, terror-struck face against the window.

Paul says, and heads to the carwash to remove the inconvenient blood from the windshield. Overcome by guilt, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne (Catherine Frot) tracks down the comatose girl (Rachida Brakni) in the hospital and soon after leaves behind her job at a law firm, her indifferent husband (Vincent Lindon) and their ungrateful college-age son to help nurse the stranger back to health. As the film moves between a loopy comedy of the sexes and a girl-power tale about seeking revenge, Ms. Serreau, who wrote and directed, also weaves in the complicated subplot about the girl, a young Algerian who runs away from home to avoid being sold by her father to a businessman and who ends up working the streets. A mishmash of genres, feminist tones and pointed commentary on French-Arab relations, ''Chaos'' which opens on Wednesday in New York before its national release, was seen by more than a million people in France.
