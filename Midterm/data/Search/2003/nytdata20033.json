The daily panorama of women thriving there, working women who seemed to rise from the very pages of the magazine -- it was, to say the least, a heady experience. Strong feelings of attachment were established, but it was a job first and foremost. Vogue could be extremely festive, but it was not a party. For instance, I learned very quickly that as a man in the office, one did not comment about a colleague's clothes or appearance. Usually a comment like ''I love what you are wearing,'' especially to the editor in chief, Anna Wintour, was met with a polite stare or curt ''Thank you.''

''Separate but equal'' applied not only to water fountains and classrooms, but also to beauty contests and gas-station pinups. In 1939, perhaps the most famous black woman in America, Hattie McDaniel, won an Oscar for her turn in ''Gone With the Wind.'' And even though she was no Halle Berry, some of her white contemporaries felt lessened by McDaniel's win.
