I read it after breakfast, when deadlines were looming. I read it on the subway heading to and from a concert. I actually finished it on a bench in my gym's locker room; I was so close to the end, I couldn't stop. Because I was so strongly affected by the novel, I was wary when I heard that the director Stephen Daldry was turning it into a film. How do you transfer such a powerfully interior book to the screen? But the reviews, over all, were excellent.

A young person making his (or, less frequently, her) way in, let's say, the C.I.A., a big-city police department or the criminal underworld would be wise to doubt the good intentions of the middle-aged, in particular of those middle-aged men who serve as designated teachers, supervisors or mentors. In Ron Shelton's latest, ''Dark Blue,'' for example, an innocent, eager young detective played by Scott Speedman is initiated, by his older partner (Kurt Russell) and his own uncle (Brendan Gleeson), into a corrupt, violent and racist cabal within the L.A.P.D. The young man's integrity, his soul and his very life are endangered by his would-be protectors' vicious and amoral code of conduct. Mr. Speedman's predicament is reminiscent of Ethan Hawke's character's in ''Training Day'' (whose screenwriter, David Ayer, also wrote ''Dark Blue''). In that picture, a young policeman's induction into an elite anti-narcotics unit became a nightmare of shakedowns, drug abuse and general lawlessness conjured up by his garrulous, sociopathic senior partner, a role for which Denzel Washington won an Oscar.", "abstract": "A O Scott article discusses movies in which older men in positions of authority betray younger men; cites dozen examples; photo (M)", "print_page": "14", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Don't Trust That Kindly, Aging Mentor", "kicker": "FILM"}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}], "pub_date": "2003-03-02T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Arts and Leisure Desk", "section_name": "Movies; Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "A.", "middlename": "O.", "lastname": "SCOTT", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By A.

GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM -- Between 1994 and 2002 Matthew Barney explored the process of creation in his epic ''Cremaster'' cycle: five feature-length films that unfold through complementary photographs, drawings, sculptures and installations. In ''Matthew Barney: The Cremaster Cycle,'' through June 11 at the museum, the artist has designed a site-specific installation centered on a five-channel video monitor suspended in the museum's rotunda.

Broadway + ''FRANKIE AND JOHNNY IN THE CLAIR DE LUNE.'' Rosie Perez, who took over from Edie Falco in Terrence McNally's comic drama of lonely souls in the big city, is a lively, sexy and engaging actress. But are such attributes virtues in ''Frankie and Johnny''? On one level, after all, the play can be described as a story of two people who are lucky to have found each other because it's clear that no one else would sleep with either one. And while this might hold true for the crazy-eyed, leering interpretation of Johnny by Joe Pantoliano (who replaced Stanley Tucci), Ms. Perez's feisty, saucy Frankie hardly comes across as the vulnerable loner that Ms. Falco was. As Ms. Perez and Mr. Pantoliano swap confessions, insults and declarations, the show develops the jittery seesaw rhythms of a sitcom. This is a breezy ''Frankie and Johnny'' that elicits easy laughs but not empathetic tears (2:20). Belasco, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200.
