With Europe increasingly alarmed about illegal immigration, three movies in competition are addressing this issue. Not that the festival, now in its 53rd year, is necessarily political. Every year it also offers major American movies that use Berlin as launch pads for European releases. This year was no different, drawing an array of Hollywood stars.
