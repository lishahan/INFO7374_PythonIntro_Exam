The longtime French antiques dealer, Chrystian Count Aubusson de Cavarlay, passed away January 29, at the age of 82 in his Easthampton home. He was a much beloved and esteemed Manhattan antiques dealer who maintained his shop, Chrystian Aubusson Antiques, starting in New York shortly after his arrival from his native France after WWII, until his retirement in 2001. His wit and wisdom, elegance and good humor will be dearly missed by all those fortunate enough to know him. His many kindnesses will be well remembered.

Instead of groups by individual or like-minded composers, Dame Felicity presented each half of the program as a unified set. Composers who worked in different languages and musical styles were heard side by side with no applause between them at Dame Felicity's request. She gave her program a title, ''Night and Day: Love Songs Round the Clock,'' and that was what she offered: there were 24 songs all told, and if they didn't match the hours exactly, the pieces she sang on the first half were set in the morning and afternoon, and those in the second half were more decisively nocturnal. She mostly drew from the formal art song repertory. But she ended the first half with Oscar Straus's cabaret song, ''Warum soll eine Frau kein Verh\u00e4ltnis haben?'' (''Why shouldn't a woman have an affair?''), and she closed the program with the Cole Porter song that gave her recital its title.", "abstract": "Allan Kozinn reviews Felicity Lott's vocal recital at Alice Tully Hall (S)", "print_page": "20", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "With a Nod to Cole Porter, Songs for Night and Day", "kicker": "MUSIC REVIEW"}, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "LOTT, FELICITY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MUSIC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}], "pub_date": "2003-01-31T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk", "section_name": "Movies; Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Allan", "rank": 1, "lastname": "KOZINN"}], "original": "By ALLAN KOZINN"}, "type_of_material": "Review", "_id": "4fd221aa8eb7c8105d7a6947", "word_count": 322, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/31/opinion/l-invoking-the-bible-in-the-war-debate-111309.html", "snippet": "To the Editor:    Re ''The Prince of Peace Was a Warrior, Too,'' by Joseph Loconte (Op-Ed, Jan. 28):...", "lead_paragraph": "To the Editor: Re ''The Prince of Peace Was a Warrior, Too,'' by Joseph Loconte (Op-Ed, Jan. 28):", "abstract": "Rev Tom Reiber-Martinez letter on Jan 28 Joseph Loconte article says Jesus never waged war in conventional sense and says that to do so is to align oneself with darkness that opposes force of love that he preached", "print_page": "28", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Invoking the Bible In the War Debate"}, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "REIBER-MARTINEZ, TOM"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "LOCONTE, JOSEPH"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "IRAQ"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ATOMIC WEAPONS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL WARFARE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TERRORISM"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNITED STATES ARMAMENT AND DEFENSE"}], "pub_date": "2003-01-31T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Editorial Desk", "section_name": "Opinion", "subsection_name": null, "byline": null, "type_of_material": "Letter", "_id": "4fd26ce78eb7c8105d825ca9", "word_count": 160, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/30/movies/no-2-spot-or-the-star-for-oscars-it-s-strategy.html", "snippet": "In the opening credits for ''The Hours,'' a drama about three women from different eras whose lives are connected by a shared despair and by a work of literature, the names of the film's stars appear in the following order: Meryl Streep, Julianne ...", "lead_paragraph": "In the opening credits for ''The Hours,'' a drama about three women from different eras whose lives are connected by a shared despair and by a work of literature, the names of the film's stars appear in the following order: Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore, Nicole Kidman.
