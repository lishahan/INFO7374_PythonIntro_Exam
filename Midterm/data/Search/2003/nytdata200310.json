Tall, awkward, driven, with preternaturally visionary eyes and an eagle-like profile, he arrived in New York in 1899 at age 22. He came from Lewiston, Me., where he was born in 1877, by way of Cleveland, already seasoned by solitude and a sense of his difference. That is to say, he knew he was gay and he had survived a childhood of nearly Dickensian proportions, including the early death of his mother, abandonment by his father and poverty that required him to leave school at 15 and work in a shoe factory. ''My childhood was vast with terror and surprise,'' he later wrote. But in true Dickensian fashion, rescue was at hand: a succession of sponsors and patrons attracted to his obvious talent and charisma. They invited him on summer retreats in Maine, where he began a lifelong immersion in literature and religious thought (Emerson, Thoreau, the James brothers and Whitman, his first idol). They enlisted painting teachers in Cleveland and paid for his study at the National Academy of Design in Manhattan. For several years he studied in New York and painted and taught painting in Maine, whose landscape was his first and last great subject. In 1909 he met Alfred Stieglitz, who immediately gave him an exhibition and made him a prominent member of the select circle of American Modernists he was cultivating and promoting -- Georgia O'Keeffe, John Marin, Arthur Dove and Charles Demuth among them.", "abstract": "Roberta Smith reviews Marsden Hartley retrospective at Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford; photos (M)", "print_page": "33", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Marsden Hartley's World: A Body Electric", "kicker": "ART REVIEW"}, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "HARTLEY, MARSDEN"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "WADSWORTH ATHENEUM"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ART"}], "pub_date": "2003-01-31T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Leisure/Weekend Desk", "section_name": "Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Roberta", "rank": 1, "lastname": "SMITH"}], "original": "By ROBERTA SMITH"}, "type_of_material": "Review", "_id": "4fd221aa8eb7c8105d7a693a", "word_count": 1905, "slideshow_credits": null}]}, "status": "OK", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
