SCHULMAN recalls being in the control room of a Hollywood sound studio as John Goodman, the actor, recorded the voice of Baloo the bear in ''The Jungle Book 2.'' As Mr. Goodman's voice resonated over a telephone line from a studio in New Orleans, a Disney executive turned to Mr. Schulman, one of the film's writers, to request additional dialogue for a roughhousing scene. But with the executive, Mr. Goodman, a dialogue director, engineers and others waiting in two studios, Mr. Schulman drew a blank. ''My brain just froze,'' he said. Trying to appear calm, Mr. Schulman quickly resorted to his black I.B.M. ThinkPad 240 notebook computer.

Bolivia is the homeland of the poker-faced immigrant Freddy (Freddy Flores), who accepts a job as a grill man at a tiny restaurant. He's hired illegally by the brusque Enrique (Enrique Liporace) and paid 15 pesos (about $4.75) a day. Just after the opening, a television blares away with a soccer game, in which the Bolivians are dismissed by an Argentine announcer.
