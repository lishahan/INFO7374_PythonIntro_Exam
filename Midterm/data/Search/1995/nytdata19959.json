They solve social problems, they keep people happy, they make communities shine with enthusiasm and, best of all, they inject a shot of money into sagging economies. The arts establishment in the United States operates on a nearly messianic certainty that the arts are not merely good, but good for you. Is it really so? Surely the economic impact of the arts is real. The explosion of interest in culture in the United States over the last generation has turned the arts into a potent industry. Study after study shows the multiplier effect of arts dollars, sowing prosperity all through the economy. The Metropolitan Museum is now the most popular tourist attraction in New York, where big exhibitions fill not only its own coffers but also those of hotels and restaurants. People clamor to get seats for major events at Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall. The arts are for everyone, and everyone seems to be for the arts.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "13", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "To Earn Subsidies, Must Art Be Useful?

In the 20th century, such artists have often arrived in pairs, with conceptions that seem at first to be almost diametrically opposed -- Picasso and Matisse, Joyce and Stein, Fellini and Bergman. Yet the tension between their sensibilities makes their common esthetic concerns stand out in bolder relief than they might otherwise have. Such a pair were the pianists Thelonious Monk and Bud Powell, who together in the 1940's staked out the playing field for their instrument in what was known as modern jazz. In styles as different as Goya's was from Manet's, Powell, who died at 41 in 1966, and Monk, who died at 64 in 1982, re-evaluated the piano's relation to its European heritage and reached nearly opposite conclusions.
