(49) ME FACING LIFE: CYNTOIA'S STORY In August 2004 Cyntoia Brown, 16, shot and killed Johnny Allen, a 43-year-old Tennessee real estate agent she said had picked her up for sex. Two years later Ms. Brown -- who had been born to a 16-year-old and adopted as a toddler -- was tried as an adult, found guilty of first-degree murder and especially aggravated robbery, and sentenced to life. In this ''Independent Lens'' presentation, Daniel H. Birman follows Ms. Brown, above, for six years, starting the week she was arrested, in the hope of exposing the reasons for violence among youth. What he discovered was a history, seemingly shaped by heredity and circumstance, that had repeated itself through each generation of Ms. Brown's biological family. 5:30 P.M. (Cinemax) FUNNY PEOPLE (2009) In this film from Judd Apatow, Adam Sandler plays George Simmons, a stand-up comedian turned Hollywood star and jerk, who discovers that he has a rare, potentially fatal blood disease. Seth Rogen is Ira, the fledgling comic George hires as an assistant, who for the time being seems only too content to accept scraps from his employer. Mr. Apatow's wife, Leslie Mann, plays Laura, the love who got away from George, and the one he wants back now that he's dying. (The Apatows' daughters play Laura's children.) Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis said there was ''something irritatingly self-satisfied'' about the film, partly stemming from the autobiographical touches. ''Watching 'Funny People,' you get the sense that Mr. Apatow, one of the most successful filmmakers working in Hollywood, is very happy,'' she wrote.
