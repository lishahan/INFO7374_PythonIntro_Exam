(Nickelodeon) POWER RANGERS: SAMURAI A new generation of Rangers must master the ancient samurai symbols of power, for control over fire, water, sky, forest and earth, in this newfangled adaptation of the popular children's series. Under the guidance of their mentor, Ji (Rene Naufahu), and with the help of their devoted animal zords, the Rangers battle to save Earth from the dark forces of the Netherworld ruled by the evil Master Xandred. Jayden (Alex Heartman) is the Red Ranger and the team's leader; Mia (Erika Fong) is the big-sisterish Pink Ranger; Kevin (Najee De-Tiege), the Blue Ranger, is an expert swordsman who adheres to a strict code of living; Emily (Brittany Pirtle) is the ever-optimistic Yellow Ranger; and Mike (Hector David Jr.), the Green Ranger, is a rebel who would rather be destroying video monsters than real ones. In this premiere episode Mike takes on a long-armed creature named Rofer. 7 P.M.

(Showtime) A SINGLE MAN (2009) Colin Firth, in the first of his Oscar-nominated roles (he's currently favored to win for best actor for ''The King's Speech''), plays George, a middle-aged professor in 1962 Los Angeles who, in one emotion-filled day, prepares to commit suicide after the death of his longtime lover, Jim (Matthew Goode). Nicholas Hoult is the flirty student and Jon Kortajarena the charming hustler who cross George's path; Julianne Moore (above with Mr. Firth) is Charley, the close friend who wishes she and George could be more. Reviewing this directorial debut from Tom Ford, the former creative director of Gucci, following the outline of the 1964 novel by Christopher Isherwood, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times: ''That Mr. Ford has placed so much weight on Mr. Firth suggests that he knows how valuable his actor is to his first effort. And while 'A Single Man' has its flaws, many of these fade in view of the performance and the power of Isherwood's story. Part of the radical importance of Isherwood's novel is its insistence on the absolute ordinariness of George's life, including with Jim, whose relationship together is pictured only briefly in both the novel and the film, and yet reverberates deeply (then as now). Mr. Ford's single man might be less common than Isherwood's, a bit too exquisitely dressed. But with Mr. Firth, Mr. Ford has created a gay man troubled by ordinary grief and haunted by joy, a man apart and yet like any other.'' 10:30 A.M.
