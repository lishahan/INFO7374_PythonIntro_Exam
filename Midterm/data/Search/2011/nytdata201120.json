(Hallmark) ACCIDENTALLY IN LOVE (2011) Jennie Garth (''Beverly Hills, 90210''), above, plays Annie, a widow and mother of a 6-year-old girl, Taylor (Dannika Northcott), who is losing her eyesight. Ethan Erickson is Eddie, the actor behind -- or rather, inside the costume of -- Mulligan the Rabbit, a popular children's television character, who, on his way to a film audition, crashes his car into Annie's. At first Eddie and Annie are enemies. And then, after Eddie invites Taylor onto the set of his show to meet Mulligan, whose human identity Eddie hasn't yet revealed, they're not. Soon Mulligan is paying for an experimental surgery that could give Taylor her vision back -- and Eddie is falling in love with Annie. Marilu Henner plays Annie's mother; Fred Willard is Eddie's manager. Peter Facinelli, Ms. Garth's husband, wrote the script. 8:15 A.M.
