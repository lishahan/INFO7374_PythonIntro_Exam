The Xeroxed photos are provocatively sexy -- Romy Schneider looking pained and delirious, Catherine Deneuve pulling her camisole down for Helmut Newton, a bare-bottomed model leaning over a fur coat on a balcony -- but this seems to bother Hayek not at all. She examines them almost as if she were the producer of the shoot rather than the subject. There is (as is customary) a slight nervousness in the room about what she will turn out to be like to work with, what she will or won't agree to. First of all, she apologizes: most of these images are of women with cigarettes dangling from their lips, but she has a rule about not smoking in pictures. Fine; a lit match is decided upon instead.
