Not so hot. Though the hosts, James Franco and Anne Hathaway, joked about being the \"hip\" Oscars from the start of the show and then acted on it -- Mr. Franco unleashed a torrent of backstage Twitter posts, and Ms. Hathaway mentioned drinking games -- their performance drew decidedly mixed reviews, especially when compared with the riffing of the 94-year-old Kirk Douglas. The \"Auto-Tune the News\" segment was a bit of a head-scratcher. And the use of the fifth-grade choir from Staten Island's P.S. 22, a YouTube sensation known for its renditions of pop and indie songs, was denuded by singing \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\" as the credits rolled. Don't get us wrong, it was still cute (and the shot of Melissa Leo singing along was sweet, especially after she dropped an obscenity in her remarks accepting her Supporting Actress Oscar).
