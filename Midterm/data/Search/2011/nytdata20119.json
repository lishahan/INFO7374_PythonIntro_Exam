Mr. Silver is the author of The Times's FiveThirtyEight blog, which is devoted to the analysis of statistics and data in politics and other areas. Two years ago, I tried to predict the Oscar winners for New York Magazine by crunching data from the last 30 years of awards history. The project was a mixed success. I got 4 out of 6 categories right, an acceptable score on paper. But several of the choices (like ''Slumdog Millionaire'' for Best Picture) were giveaways and conversely, the system's longshot pick -- Taraji P. Henson for her role in ''The Curious Case of Benjamin Button'' -- was a total flop.", "abstract": "Nate Silver uncovers four key tips for predicting Academy Awards winners.
