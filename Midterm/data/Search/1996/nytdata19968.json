With the tone of a fable and the lulling bucolic look of a pastoral fantasy, it tells of one strong woman and her talented descendants, all blessed with self-sufficiency and remarkably little need for men in their lives. Indeed, the fact that the sturdy, formidable Antonia (Willeke van Ammelrooy) perpetuates her bloodline at all becomes one of the film's more fanciful little miracles. As written and directed with quirky charm by Marleen Gorris, whose earlier \"Broken Mirrors\" and \"A Question of Silence\" were much more strident, \"Antonia's Line\" begins and ends on the day of Antonia's death. As with magical realism, there is a certainty that the natural world will cooperate with the characters' sense of certitude, and it does.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "18", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "A Line of Strong Women With Faith in Destiny", "kicker": "FILM REVIEW"}, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "ANTONIA'S LINE (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}], "pub_date": "1996-02-02T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Weekend Desk", "section_name": "Movies; Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Janet", "rank": 1, "lastname": "MASLIN"}], "original": "By JANET MASLIN"}, "type_of_material": "Review", "_id": "4fd203748eb7c8105d769c84", "word_count": 684, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/02/movies/home-video-014125.html", "snippet": "Foraging Abroad...", "lead_paragraph": "Foraging Abroad", "abstract": null, "print_page": "26", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Home Video"}, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "NATURAL BORN KILLERS (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "GREAT BRITAIN"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "AUSTRALIA"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "NEW ZEALAND"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NICKELODEON"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "PARAMOUNT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECORDINGS (VIDEO)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TELEVISION"}], "pub_date": "1996-02-02T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Weekend Desk", "section_name": "Movies; Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1}], "original": "By Peter M.
