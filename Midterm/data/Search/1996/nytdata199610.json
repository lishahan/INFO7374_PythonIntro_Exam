In a 1944 film, directed by Jules Dassin, the ghost was played by Charles Laughton, surrounded by a cast that included Margaret O'Brien, Robert Young and Peter Lawford. This time, updated in a way that would probably give Wilde the shivers, he is portrayed by the peripatetic Patrick Stewart, possessor of one of the most authoritative voices in show business. Mr. Stewart also happens to be a producer. In this modern-day version of the ghost story, Hiram Otis (Edward Wiley), an American physics professor who has been given a research grant in England, sends for his family to join him. His wife, Lucille (Cheri Lunghi), and his two young bratty sons (Ciaran Fitzgerald and Raymond Pickard) look forward to the adventure. But his eldest child, 16-year-old Virginia (Neve Campbell of \"Party of Five\") goes reluctantly, wondering if she's about to die of boredom even as a splendid Rolls-Royce carries the family to the fantastic old castle.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "17", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "A Modern-Day Version of Wilde's Ghost Story", "kicker": "TV WEEKEND"}, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "CANTERVILLE GHOST, THE (TV PROGRAM)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "AIDA FILE, THE (TV PROGRAM)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TELEVISION"}], "pub_date": "1996-01-26T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Weekend Desk", "section_name": "Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "John", "middlename": "J.", "lastname": "O'CONNOR", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By JOHN J.

Better believe it. Because as of last year the Sundance Film Festival was the world's preeminent event of its kind. To some degree, that happened by default. Hollywood went brain-dead and created an artistic vacuum; glittery events like the Cannes and Venice film festivals reflected the weakened state of world cinema; the New York Film Festival felt the same pinch and assembled more small, good films than great ones. Serious events like those in Toronto and Montreal delivered solid films but minimal buzz.
