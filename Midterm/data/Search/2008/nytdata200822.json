There's nothing in my review tomorrow about Jil Sander, though I did wonder if the tulle-veiled tweed and embroidered skirts, etc. at Herrera and Oscar started with Raf Simons' transparency collection for spring. I think the only point of comparison between Sander and Halston is that both designers had to clean house a bit with their brands, find the main points. (I hate that dreaded word DNA; I expect to find bodies.) After two or three seasons of establishing a line and his tailoring, as well as the great dresses, Simons has felt free to do more with Jil. I suspect Marco Zanini will do the same thing. The guy is smart, and not affected by the side-show dramas. And look at all the boxy, flaring and embellished jackets we've seen on the runways this week-the oversized grunge plaid at Preen, the A-line shapes at Herrera, the tweed numbers at Oscar. And who does a super-simple, sharp-shouldered, one-button jacket with a slim skirt (on Freja) and makes it look new? Mister Zanini. That was my favorite look in the show. It's all about knowing what to eliminate. I agree with Marco about the 70s context thing, though I looked at it differently in the review. Halson was not about the furnishings; he was about the architecture: line and cut, and color for visual impact and warmth. So what was Liza M. doing in the front row? Why do the new owners feel they have to sell Halston by telling the history?
