While he found his m\u00e9tier as a portrait photographer, he also played the role of dandy, diarist, Oscar-winning costumer and, oddly enough, fabric designer. Now, through the London interior design company Beaudesert and the archives of Ascher Studio, reproductions of Beaton\u2019s checks, florals and stripes are being sold at Liberty of London. The Cecil Beaton fabric collection \u2014 on silk, cotton, linen and wallpaper \u2014 was inspired by a scarf that Beaudesert\u2019s managing director, Andrew Ginger, found on eBay; Beaton had originally designed it for the textile firm Ascher. In the 1940s and early \u201950s, Zika Ascher commissioned artists such as Henri Matisse and Henry Moore to design fabrics, paying them \u00a325 per motif, according to his son, Peter. All the big designers, like Balenciaga, Givenchy, Lanvin and Yves Saint Laurent, would buy their fabrics from Ascher Studio. Although not known for his brush strokes, Beaton was an obvious choice for fabric, and Zika allowed him free rein. \u201cAn artist with a color sense is not someone you mess with,\u201d Zika has been quoted as saying. The timing couldn\u2019t be better, as this spring\u2019s runways were full of blossoms. Can\u2019t you just see the Beaton bouquet on your fainting couch?
