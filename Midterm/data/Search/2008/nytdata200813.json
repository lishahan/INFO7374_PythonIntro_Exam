But the menu is do-it-yourself, which makes life more than difficult for the head chef, who must concoct unfamiliar dishes for each order.

Among those offering their opinions: the economist Milton Friedman; the billionaire Adnan Khashoggi; Roy O. Martin, a Louisiana lumber tycoon who spends with the Bible as his guide; Chuck Collins, a great-grandson of Oscar Mayer who gave up his inheritance for moral reasons; and Bill Gates Sr., the father of the richest man in the United States.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "10", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "What's On Tonight"}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2008-02-21T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "The Arts/Cultural Desk", "section_name": "Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Kathryn", "lastname": "SHATTUCK"}], "original": "By KATHRYN SHATTUCK"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd2b2b08eb7c8105d8a3cf1", "word_count": 480, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/21/fashion/21CRITIC.html", "snippet": "In many stores, one feels starved of proper influence from the past, but the designer Adam Lippes doesn\u2019t have this problem....", "lead_paragraph": "In many stores, one feels starved of proper influence from the past, but the designer Adam Lippes doesn\u2019t have this problem.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "4", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [{"width": 600, "url": "images/2008/02/20/fashion/21crit600.1.jpg", "height": 300, "subtype": "xlarge", "legacy": {"xlargewidth": "600", "xlarge": "images/2008/02/20/fashion/21crit600.1.jpg", "xlargeheight": "300"}, "type": "image"}, {"width": 75, "url": "images/2008/02/20/fashion/21crit75.jpg", "height": 75, "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"thumbnailheight": "75", "thumbnail": "images/2008/02/20/fashion/21crit75.jpg", "thumbnailwidth": "75"}, "type": "image"}], "headline": {"seo": "Adam-retail", "main": "Do You Get Where He\u2019s Coming From?", "content_kicker": "Critical Shopper | Adam", "kicker": "Critical Shopper | Adam", "print_headline": "Do You Get Where He\u2019s Coming From?"}, "keywords": [{"rank": "1", "is_major": "N", "name": "subject", "value": "Dresses"}, {"rank": "3", "is_major": "N", "name": "subject", "value": "Retail Stores and Trade"}], "pub_date": "2008-02-21T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Styles", "section_name": "Fashion & Style", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Cintra", "rank": 1, "lastname": "WILSON"}], "original": "By CINTRA WILSON"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "547e224438f0d84a61c0e3a2", "word_count": "1019", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/21/fashion/21brides.html", "snippet": "The inspiration for wedding gowns is often borrowed straight  from the red carpet.
