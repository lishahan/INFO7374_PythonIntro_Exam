For a parent Sesame Street Live doesn't have quite the charm of ''Sesame Street'' on television. You lose the intimacy of the close-ups with the cheery characters, and the noise -- including the loud bangs of containers of confetti bursting over the audience's heads -- may make you long for a remote control. But enough Oscar-like grouchiness. None of this seems to bother the energetic toddlers who throng Madison Square Garden every year for the 90-minute live extravaganza.
