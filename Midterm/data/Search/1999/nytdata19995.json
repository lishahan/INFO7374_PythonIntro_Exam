She has become accustomed to getting letters, mostly from America, asking her where she has been hiding and what acting she has done. If she were a pedantic person, she might reply that, well, she has been playing leading roles in the theater for four decades and that her work onstage won her the title of Dame of the British Empire in 1988. If she were feeling immodest, Dame Judi might add that she is widely regarded in British theater circles as the greatest living English actress. But she knows that only a minuscule proportion of the world's population has seen her Cleopatra or Lady Macbeth, her brassy Mother Courage or her oddly young and sexually susceptible Lady Bracknell. She is well aware that there are at least two good reasons why she has achieved international renown only in her 60's.", "abstract": "Benedict Nightingale profile of leading British stage actress Dame Judi Dench, who will star in play Amy's View, her first New York appearance in 40 years; photos (M)", "print_page": "10", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Who Is This Dame?
