Since Jennifer is being portrayed by the intelligent, luminous young movie star Uma Thurman, it would seem difficult to quarrel with this assessment. As a screen presence Ms. Thurman hasn't really registered as naive since her virginal, teen-aged character in ''Dangerous Liaisons'' was debauched by John Malkovich a decade ago. Yet in the Classic Stage Company's production of Martin Crimp's contemporary adaptation of Moliere's ''Misanthrope,'' Ms. Thurman gives off an uneasy innocence that would doubtless cause much lip-curling among the wry, worldly and exotic women she has essayed beguilingly in films like ''Henry and June,'' ''Pulp Fiction'' and ''Batman and Robin.''
