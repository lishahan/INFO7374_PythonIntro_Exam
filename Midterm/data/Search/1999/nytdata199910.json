If they succeed, it will be quite a coup. Although there's no reason to question Columbia Pictures when it maintains that Ms. Sarandon has a few more lines, it is, nevertheless, Ms. Roberts who has top billing, the title role and, of course, that smile. Similarly, Billy Bob Thornton may nab a supporting nomination for ''A Simple Plan,'' in which his role as the dimwitted brother is only slightly less pivotal than Bill Paxton's more levelheaded sibling. In fact, Mr. Thornton is pretty much a part of the brothers' simple plan from start to finish. In ''A Civil Action,'' there is no arguing that Robert Duvall plays second fiddle to John Travolta. But in less competitive years, Mr. Duvall's high-powered lawyer might have been a best-actor contender. (Let's not forget that Anthony Hopkins won best actor for 17 minutes of screen time in ''Silence of the Lambs.'')

It was, it turned out, an ad hoc protest by a group of ultrareligious Jews upset at some parts of the play, in which Hare uses his recent experiences in Israel and the West Bank as a prism to examine the region's deep conflicts. Even the coincidental presence in the audience of an incensed Harold Pinter, fiercely hissing ''Shut up! Shut up!'' in the dark, didn't put an end to it. The noise increased and rose up at the playwright, all alone on the stage, driving him to the brink of explosion. But he never exploded. ''I wanted to stop and say something, and I know they wanted me to stop,'' he says several months later, safely offstage in his thoroughly comfortable office in Hampstead, one of London's nicest neighborhoods. Handsome and self-assured, he has a deep, rich voice and speaks rapidly but in complete paragraphs that are free of sentence fragments, flabby constructions and inapt words. ''If you say something, you're dead -- you never get the audience back. I've never been more relieved in my life that I didn't do something.''", "abstract": "Jonathan Van Meter article on the proliferation of one-person shows, most of which appear stuck in the autobiographical mode; photo (L)", "print_page": "44", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "And Another Thing From David Hare"}, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "VAN METER, JONATHAN"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "THEATER"}], "pub_date": "1999-02-07T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Magazine Desk", "section_name": "Theater; Magazine", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Sarah", "rank": 1, "lastname": "Lyall"}], "original": "By Sarah Lyall"}, "type_of_material": "Biography", "_id": "4fd21e138eb7c8105d79fb7f", "word_count": 3102, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/05/books/books-of-the-times-unlike-mambo-kings-an-empress-tidies-up.html", "snippet": "EMPRESS OF THE SPLENDID SEASON  By Oscar Hijuelos  342 pages.
