Most readers are undoubtedly familiar with the ennobling sentiments Mr. Schlesinger has expressed on behalf of an open, just and democratic society in such classics as ''The Vital Center'' and ''The Disuniting of America.'' But there also seems to be a paradoxical side to his vaunted liberalism that is far too ready to countenance extremism in the service of liberal ideals where unpopular social and political movements are concerned. Mr. Schlesinger writes that ''the idea that the presence of a few Stalinists and fellow-travelers in the film industry was a grave threat to the republic rates high in the annals of Congressional asininity.'' One wonders, then, what clear and present dangers to the Republic could possibly have been averted by Mr. Kazan's collaboration with the House Un-American Activities Committee and its reckless ruination of talented lives.", "abstract": "Letter from David Levering Lewis replies to Arthur Schlesinger Jr's Feb 28 Op-Ed deploring hypocrisy of those who protest award of honorary Oscar to Elia Kazan, who he informed on others during McCarthy era; says distinguished historians such as Schlesinger persist in conviction that victimization in defense of liberty is virtue", "print_page": "18", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "An Undeserved Oscar?"}, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "SCHLESINGER, ARTHUR M JR"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "LEWIS, DAVID LEVERING"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "KAZAN, ELIA"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ACADEMY AWARDS (OSCARS)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BLACKLISTING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "INFORMERS"}], "pub_date": "1999-03-02T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Editorial Desk", "section_name": "Opinion", "subsection_name": null, "byline": null, "type_of_material": "Letter", "_id": "4fd224d48eb7c8105d7ab2af", "word_count": 217, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/02/movies/footlights.html", "snippet": "NEWS    Profit With Honor    Already the recipient of 13 Oscar nominations, ''Shakespeare in Love'' led with 15 nominations yesterday when contenders for the 51st British Academy of Film and Television Awards were announced in London.
