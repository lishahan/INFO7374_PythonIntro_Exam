First, of course, will be Tennessee Williams's fierce, lyrical prison play, having its belated New York premiere 61 years after it was written. And second, playing the central role of the warden, will be Corin Redgrave, who has not been on Broadway since 1963 and who is the least known of the famous acting Redgraves.

Tucked at the end of the list of nominees for best foreign film, just below Roberto Benigni's ubiquitous ''Life Is Beautiful,'' is ''Tango,'' an entry from Argentina that is the work of the hugely gifted, hugely perplexing Spanish director Carlos Saura. It would be wonderful in any case for the 67-year-old Saura to be noted again for Oscar consideration (his ''Carmen'' was nominated in 1983). But it is especially gratifying with ''Tango,'' because while ''Tango'' is certainly a dance film -- the sort of film that Mr. Saura has come to be associated with in the last 20 years -- it is not a dance film above all. Here, the director's distinctive way of depicting dance from the inside out does not overshadow his more venerable gift for commenting in a dramatic narrative on subjects like political repression, personal loss and emotional survival.", "abstract": "Will Joyner profile of Carlos Saura, Spanish director of film Tango; photos (M)2", "print_page": "21", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "A Depictor of Dance Reaches Beyond It", "kicker": "FILM"}, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "TANGO (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "SAURA, CARLOS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION"}], "pub_date": "1999-02-21T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Arts and Leisure Desk", "section_name": "Movies; Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Will", "rank": 1, "lastname": "JOYNER"}], "original": "By WILL JOYNER"}, "type_of_material": "Biography", "_id": "4fd20d848eb7c8105d77df62", "word_count": 1126, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/21/books/the-palmer-method.html", "snippet": "BE COOL  By Elmore Leonard.  292 pp. New York:  Delacorte Press. $24.95.

Ask an English theatergoer of a certain age, and one hears of the defining impact made in London by the original Broadway productions (occasionally with their New York leads) of ''Company,'' ''West Side Story'' or even ''Oklahoma!'' Both ''Annie Get Your Gun'' and ''The Sound of Music'' had longer initial runs on the West End than they did on Broadway.

And what about Diana Rigg's recent visit in ''Phedre'' and ''Britannicus'' at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, where ''Blue Heart,'' the double bill by Caryl Churchill, winds up its run today? Then there was Matthew Bourne's ''Swan Lake,'' the ballet that played Broadway as comfortably as a musical. Speaking of Broadway, half a dozen more theaters are about to open their doors to productions that have already won attention in London: Kevin Spacey in ''The Iceman Cometh'' and Dame Judi Dench in ''Amy's View'' among them. What does it all mean? And what about traffic the other way? This special section on theater tries to answer those questions, starting off with a conversation among the three theater critics of The New York Times: Ben Brantley, Vincent Canby and Peter Marks.
