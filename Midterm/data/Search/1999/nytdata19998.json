A week after the groundhog visits his shadow, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences releases its Oscar nominations, which lie before us now like so many tea leaves. The question is not whether Tom Hanks can win the best actor award one more time, but what it would say about us if he did. Does the pattern of nominations -- ''Shakespeare in Love'' trumping ''Saving Private Ryan,'' Jim Carrey going wholly unmentioned -- reflect the sour, shameful mood of a nation burdened by an impeachment trial? Or does it capture the powerful surge of our economy, the flood tide of job creation, and optimism over a long-lasting boom? There is a tendency to read these nominations as if they were the results of a nationwide poll, a more impartial verdict on the state of the union than the President was able to deliver when he appeared before Congress last month. But how can that verdict be accurate when ''There's Something About Mary'' -- one of the year's most popular if moronic films -- is up for nothing?", "abstract": "Editorial scoffs at tendency to read too much social significance into Oscar nominations", "print_page": "32", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Prognosticating Oscar"}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ACADEMY AWARDS (OSCARS)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EDITORIALS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AWARDS, DECORATIONS AND HONORS"}], "pub_date": "1999-02-11T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Editorial Desk", "section_name": "Opinion", "subsection_name": null, "byline": null, "type_of_material": "Editorial", "_id": "4fd1e7fd8eb7c8105d735b0e", "word_count": 339, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/11/nyregion/news-summary-290025.html", "snippet": "INTERNATIONAL   A3-17    Pentagon Questioning Risks and Goals in Kosovo  Senior Pentagon officials are raising serious concerns about sending American troops into Kosovo without clear-cut military goals, even as NATO contemplates sending peacekeep...", "lead_paragraph": "INTERNATIONAL A3-17 Pentagon Questioning Risks and Goals in Kosovo Senior Pentagon officials are raising serious concerns about sending American troops into Kosovo without clear-cut military goals, even as NATO contemplates sending peacekeepers there.
