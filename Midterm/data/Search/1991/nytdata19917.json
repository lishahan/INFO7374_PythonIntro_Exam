Joycean. Outwardly the eminent biographer of Joyce could hardly have been more different from his subject. Joyce was, in his own words, \"a small man, prone to alcoholism\"; Ellmann was a moderate drinker and a rather bulky man, with a balding brow and a flat Midwestern accent that years of dining at High Table with murmurous Oxford dons had failed to mitigate. Maybe it was his effortless fidelity to his own nature that made him such a shrewd interpreter of others. Ellmann treated his subjects -- William Butler Yeats, James Joyce, Oscar Wilde -- with a benign, avuncular tolerance. He noted, and forgave, their failings. Even the title of his biographical essays on the major modernists, \"Golden Codgers\" -- the phrase is from Yeats -- reflected his affection for the writers to whom he devoted his life. Ellmann was drawn to genius, yet was himself an ordinary man -- the Leopold Bloom of biography. What made Ellmann's biography of Joyce the masterpiece that it is? Not every great writer earns a great biography. Hemingway has been ill-served by Carlos Baker and Kenneth S. Lynn, among others. Joseph Conrad lies crushed beneath the weight of Frederick Karl's tombstone-sized biography, while J. R. Ackerley, a minor literary journalist in the London of the 1940's, has been resurrected in Peter Parker's marvelous biography. Who reads the works of Baron Corvo now? We read the work of his biographer, A. J. A. Symons (himself the subject of an excellent biography by his brother, Julian). What matters, in the end, is how passionately the biographer responds to the life he's writing about, how deeply it taps into his own preoccupations. \"A good biography is prompted not by the inherent qualities of its subject,\" argued Julian Symons in his introduction to his brother's book \"The Quest for Corvo,\" \"but by the biographer's unconsciously realized opportunity for self-expression.\" In Joyce, Ellmann found a subject who elicited his own gifts.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Whose Life Is This, Anyway?"}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "TERMS NOT AVAILABLE"}], "pub_date": "1991-01-13T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Book Review Desk", "section_name": "Arts; Books", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "James", "rank": 1, "lastname": "Atlas"}], "original": "By James Atlas; James Atlas is an editor of The New York Times Magazine; he is at work on a biography of Saul Bellow"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd1c5cb8eb7c8105d6f66ac", "word_count": 3424, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/13/world/aquino-s-new-chief-of-staff-is-raising-hopes-in-manila.html", "snippet": "The young and energetic Oscar Orbos, newly appointed executive secretary to President Corazon C.
