The play was first presented on Broadway in 1937 by the company's namesake, the W.P.A. Federal Theater, and has a minor significance in the history of black theater. In this play, his sole Broadway venture, Mr. Allison, a writer of detective fiction who died in 1974, combined an interest in law, biology and sociology. The scientific aspects of the case have faded into a kind of idiosyncratic polemicism, if not racism, but the legal side of the whodunit still retains a certain theatrical viability.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "18", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "STAGE: 'TRIAL OF DR.

Collectors dote on them, alternating between tears and hysterical laughter. Fortunately, it should be said at the outset, ''The Competition'' is better musically than most, and in the piano competition part of the film really tries hard to come to grips with the phenomenon. We all have our favorites. Mine was a thing called ''I've Always Loved You,'' which came out in 1946. This all-time low about serious music had a woman named Catherine McLeod as a pianist and someone named Philip Dorn as a conductor. He stood in front of an orchestra making gestures like a heavy pelican flapping its wings for a takeoff. As a pianist she was of the elbow-waving school, with her torso revolving around her neck.
