By KIRK HONEYCUTT LOS ANGELES About 10 years ago a screenwriter came to Lillian Michelson, a motion picture research librarian, and asked her to research a movie to take place in contemporary India. It would be a love story, he said, in which a Brahman man, a member of the very highest caste, marries an untouchable woman, from the lowest caste in Hindu society. Mrs. Michelson recalls: ''I told him, 'I haven't done any research on India but I really feel that's totally improbable.' So I spent three weeks in the stacks at UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles), came back and said, 'No way. There are 5,000 subcastes and it's very difficult for one even to go to the next one. But 5,000 - it's as if a human being were to marry a lizard. That's how unthinkable it would be.
