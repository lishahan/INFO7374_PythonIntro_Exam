Lehman College Center for the Performing Arts. That there is of course, more to this company than rock ballets was obvious in even the first of the two programs on view here. Friday night's selection consisted of George Balanchine's ''Concerto Barocco,'' Brian Macdonald's ''Double Quartet'' and ''Tam Ti Delam'' and Milko Sparemblek's ''The Miraculous Mandarin.'' This kind of touring repertory, which includes American modern dance on other programs, invites the label of eclecticism. Yet it also suggests an artistic profile that distinguishes Les Grands Ballets Canadiens from Canada's other two major ballet companies.

The leftist forces withdrew to the mountains and began regrouping. If they fail in their next push, their leaders said privately, they hope at least to win a place at the bargaining table. And if there are no negotiations, they will revert to ''prolonged popular war.'' Washington seemed to agree that the guerrillas remain a threat. It renewed military aid to the junta last month, arguing that the guerrillas were receiving arms from Cuba and Nicaragua.

Soon, audiences may routinely learn who put the hamburger, as well as the foie gras, under the klieg lights. Movie food has come a long way since James Cagney pushed a halfgrapefruit into Mae Clark's face in the 1931 classic, ''The Public Enemy.'' Along with makeup, hair styles, costumes and sets, food is becoming a favorite prop, relied on to establish character and mood.
