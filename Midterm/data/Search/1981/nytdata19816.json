I like to be their malaise and render everything they don't want to see.'' There is irony in his words because, at the age of 32 with 39 films behind him, he not only seems to be France's most ubiquitous actor, but the one who has done most to replace the stereotype of the elegant ''French lover'' with his own working class roughness and intense physical presence. Beyond these characteristics, there is what Bertrand Blier, who directed him in ''Going Places'' and the Oscar-winning ''Get Out Your Handkerchiefs,'' terms ''a wonderful inner madness.'' In New York, the past fall and current winter have largely been Mr. Depardieu's seasons, with three of his films on display - Maurice Pialat's ''Loulou,'' Francois Truffaut's ''The Last Metro'' and Alain Resnais's ''Mon Oncle d'Amerique. ''Loulou'' and ''The Last Metro'' played at the New York Film Festival, after which ''Loulou'' enjoyed an extended commercial run that only recently ended.
