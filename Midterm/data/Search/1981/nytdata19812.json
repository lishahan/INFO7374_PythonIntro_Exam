Another woman followed, the front pockets of her new olive green military jacket bulging with Soviet-made hand grenades; she led a horse burdened with burlap bags of corn in which the shapes of automatic rifles could just barely be seen. At intervals that would minimize casualties in case of an ambush came an accountant, bank clerk, printer and college student, each taking a turn at shouldering heavy crates of grenades and ammunition. They hiked for two hours through tunnels of trees and beside fields of prickly hemp bushes, past clusters of mud huts where peasants offered them oranges and wished them ''Godspeed,'' until they reached their camp, hidden in a tropical forest on the side of a volcano. Only a few days before, an army search-and-destroy mission had passed within a few hundred yards of the site, but now, on this warm January evening, expectations were high among the guerrillas.

THE problem with socialism, Oscar Wilde is supposed to have said, is that it would require too many evenings. For anyone involved in the antiwar movement during the 1960's - or, for that matter, in tenant politics, union politics or even conservative politics - Wilde's words must be among the most prescient political comments ever offered. At evening gatherings of the politically assiduous, victory frequently goes not to the wisest or to the strongest, or even to the majority, but to the loudest, and to those who can sit and sit and sit. This fact proved a constant source of difficulty for the New Left. Deeply committed to a theory of politics that emphasized participation, the New Left wanted to bring people out of their homes, away from their television sets - ''out of isolation and into community'' (in the words of the Port Huron Statement, issued by Students for a Democratic Society in 1962).", "abstract": null, "print_page": "12", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "DEMOCRATIC DEMOCRACY"}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "DEMOCRACY (THEORY AND PHILOSOPHY)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BOOKS AND LITERATURE"}], "pub_date": "1981-02-22T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Book Review Desk", "section_name": "Arts; Books", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"qualifier": "JR.", "firstname": "E.", "middlename": "J.", "lastname": "DIONNE", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By E.J.
