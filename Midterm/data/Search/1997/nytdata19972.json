She needed to sink into oblivion, as a Dadaist who didn't flee Nazi Germany. Fortunately, she survived the war there, stashing away not just her own work but also irreplaceable Dada documents. She spent the rest of her life quietly working in that house, emerging from her oblivion during her last decades to get a measure of belated renown, which has only grown since her death in 1978, at 88. Now more than 100 of her photomontages are in a fine show at the Museum of Modern Art. A visitor once described her studio in Heiligensee. In the middle was a big table, nearly invisible beneath cartons of old newspapers, mounds of clippings from magazines and brochures, pots of glue and a pair of scissors. When the visitor reached for the scissors, Hoch reacted more or less the way Heifetz might have if a stranger had suddenly picked up his Stradivarius, which is to say not well, and the scissors were swiftly put back on the table.", "abstract": "Michael Kimmelman reviews photomontages of late German Dadaist Hannah Hoch, at Museum of Modern Art in New York; photo (M)", "print_page": "1", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Dada Dearest: An Artist Alone With Her Calling", "kicker": "ART REVIEW"}, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "HOCH, HANNAH"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "MUSEUM OF MODERN ART"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ART"}], "pub_date": "1997-02-28T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Weekend Desk", "section_name": "Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Michael", "rank": 1, "lastname": "KIMMELMAN"}], "original": "By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN"}, "type_of_material": "Review", "_id": "4fd1cd338eb7c8105d7040de", "word_count": 1658, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/28/nyregion/trusts-and-estates-give-to-neediest-cases-fund.html", "snippet": "The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund has issued a list of trusts and estates that contributed to its 85th annual campaign, which ends today.

Born in New York to a family coming from Siena, Italy, Mr. Roy Rossetti served as Executive Secretary of the Italy America Chamber of Commerce for twelve years, until 1995, working with six different presidents, thus becoming a focal point amongst the business community that lives and operates in this area, trading between Italy and the U.S. Hard working, loyal and imaginative, Mr. Rossetti carried out the activities of the Chamber, initiating and cultivating business and commercial contacts both in Italy and the United States. He proved to be instrumental in shaping the guidelines of the Chamber and creating new programs aimed to its improvement and development. His leading presence in the Chamber assured the continuity of the commercial bonds between the two countries and was therfore of key importance. It is also thanks to him that the Italy-America Chamber of Commerce, the first Chamber in this country linking Italy and the United States, founded in 1887, is the main point of reference for business men of the two countries. For all these reasons the President of the Republic of Italy, Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, bestowed upon him the honorific title of Commendatore in the Order of Merit of the Republic of Italy. Mr. Rossetti is survived by his beloved wife, Paola, daughter Claudia, along with relatives and numerous friends.
