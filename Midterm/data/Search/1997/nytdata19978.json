The first stage production was a triumph, with the roles of the black cook and two white children played by Ethel Waters, Julie Harris and Brandon de Wilde. A 1982 television version adapted by Miss McCullers for ''NBC Live Theater'' starred Pearl Bailey and Dana Hill. It was produced by David W. Rintels, who is the writer and producer of this new version, directed by another distinguished television veteran, Fielder Cook. The story, set in Georgia in 1944, has been both snipped (there is no epilogue about what happened to the characters a year later) and opened up a bit (the first scene takes place at a carnival where the ''freak show'' features a half-man, half-woman, signaling the persistent theme of sexual ambiguity). But the heart of the play remains the intense relationships played out between the woman and the children.", "abstract": "John J O'Connor reviews TV movie The Member of the Wedding on USA Network (M)", "print_page": "14", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Tough Georgia Summer For Adolescent Tomboy", "kicker": "TELEVISION REVIEW"}, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "MEMBER OF THE WEDDING, THE (TV PROGRAM)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TELEVISION"}], "pub_date": "1997-01-28T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Cultural Desk", "section_name": "Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "John", "middlename": "J.", "lastname": "O'CONNOR", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By JOHN J.
