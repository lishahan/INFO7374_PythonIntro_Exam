After he meets Aimee (Maria Bonnevie, above, with Mr. Kaas) and realizes they are meant for each other, he tries to go home but finds that there is no longer a door to what should be his apartment. And no one knows him, even his longtime girlfriend (Ms. Bonnevie in a Frances Farmer hairdo), which is both good and bad news. The fact that Aimee's husband (Krister Henriksson) writes romantic novels may explain a lot. The film, directed by Christoffer Boe, won the Cam\u00e9ra d'Or, the award for best first feature, at the Cannes Film Festival. DIRTY PRETTY THINGS (2002) Friday at 8:15 p.m. on IFC Stephen Frears directed this touching, understated drama about illegal immigrants in London. Chiwetel Ejiofor stars as Okwe, who was a doctor in Nigeria but now drives a taxi and works nights at a hotel's front desk. One night he is trying to fix a clogged toilet when he discovers, of all things, a human heart. This leads him to a black-market trade in human organs. Audrey Tautou (left, with Mr. Ejiofor), looking nothing like her ''Am\u00e9lie'' character, plays a hotel maid in trouble with immigration officials. That's Sophie Okonedo, of ''Hotel Rwanda,'' as Juliette the unflappable prostitute. 100 MEN AND A GIRL (1937) Monday at 8 p.m. on TCM This cheery Depression-era Henry Koster musical is a winner. Deanna Durbin plays a golly-gee kind of teenager who helps out her father (Adolphe Menjou), an unemployed trombonist, by meeting some rich people (who find her terribly amusing) and hatching a plan to create a new symphony made up of out-of-work musicians. The hardest part will be to get the great Leopold Stokowski (Stokowski himself, in what is much more than a cameo) to conduct. Durbin (above, with Mischa Auer, as the flutist next door) sings a little pop (''It's Raining Sunbeams'') and a little opera (''La Traviata''). Charles Previn (Andr\u00e9's father's cousin, thus Soon-Yi's grandfather's cousin) won the Oscar for best score. HIDE AND SEEK (2005) Sunday at 11 p.m., Thursday at 9 p.m. and Thursday/Early Friday at 4:35 a.m. on HBO It's a pedestrian little horror plot, about a psychologist who moves to the country with his daughter after his wife's suicide. But with Robert De Niro and Dakota Fanning (left) in the roles, this thriller, directed by John Polson, is worth a look. The new neighbors are a little too obviously creepy, and the girl's new imaginary friend, Charlie, isn't creepy enough, but there's a satisfying plot twist. And it's entertaining to see Dakota, who turns 12 this week, looking so much like Christina Ricci in her ''Addams Family'' days.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "3", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Movies", "kicker": "CRITIC'S CHOICE"}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2006-02-19T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Television", "section_name": "Movies", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Anita", "lastname": "Gates"}], "original": "By Anita Gates"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd251e58eb7c8105d7f6ff6", "word_count": 475, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/19/realestate/19hunt.html", "snippet": "As nice as their Upper West Side rental was, the craving for space finally won out for David Alan Basche and his wife, Alysia Reiner....", "lead_paragraph": "AS nice as their Upper West Side rental was, the craving for space finally won out for David Alan Basche and his wife, Alysia Reiner.

By the time of the Academy Awards, which this year will take place on March 5, the spirit of the contest seems to take precedence over artistic achievement. This year, as in the previous two, The New York Times Magazine has tried to eschew this notion of competition by saluting the performances that moved, surprised and thrilled us, regardless of whether they were nominated for awards. Some -- like Reese Witherspoon's in ''Walk the Line'' -- have been acknowledged by Oscar, while others -- like Pen\u00e9lope Cruz's in the Italian film ''Don't Move'' -- were barely seen in America. And while it's very likely that you've caught Heath Ledger's heartbreaking turn in ''Brokeback Mountain,'' you may have easily missed the explosive German film ''Head-On,'' which starred Sibel Kekilli and Birol \u00dcnel. In 2005, George Clooney may have had the most diverse year in film: he packed on weight to play a wary, melancholic C.I.A. agent in the largely overlooked ''Syriana'' and then masterminded and starred in ''Good Night, and Good Luck,'' the story of Edward R. Murrow's clash with Senator Joseph McCarthy. Performances as enthralling and complex as those by (the nominated) Philip Seymour Hoffman in ''Capote'' or (the unnominated) Jeff Daniels in ''The Squid and the Whale'' should not be overshadowed by the suspense of who will and who won't receive a statuette.

Depressing News From Coldplay Proves Unfounded No, Coldplay is not breaking up. Haste was made yesterday to scuttle that rumor, which spread after its singer, Chris Martin, made what was interpreted as a farewell statement at the Brit Awards in London on Wednesday, the BBC reported. His remarks promptly depressed the stock of EMI, the parent of Capitol Records, which released the four-member band's album ''X&Y,'' winner of the prize for best British album. Mr. Martin, left, told the audience: ''You won't see us at one of these for many, many years, so this is our last chance, so we should really thank our label for the first time in history. We won't see you for a long time. Bye. We mean it. Bye.'' A spokesman for the band said Coldplay was ''not quitting'' and would be starting work soon on new material. He added, ''Coldplay are on the road until July, when their 16-month X&Y World Tour ends in Japan.'' 'Lion Sleeps Tonight' Lawsuit Is Settled A protracted legal dispute over the copyright to the internationally popular tune ''The Lion Sleeps Tonight'' has been settled with a payment to the family of Solomon Linda, the Zulu migrant worker who composed it under the title ''Mbube.'' Lawyers acting for his heirs said yesterday in Johannesburg that Abilene Music, which administered its copyright in the United States, had agreed to settle for an undisclosed sum, Reuters reported. The heirs live in poverty in the township of Soweto. Since the song was written in 1939, it has earned an estimated $15 million, been recorded by at least 150 artists around the world and been featured in the Disney film ''The Lion King'' as well as onstage. Herman Blignaut, a lawyer for the family, said the amount of the settlement was confidential, ''but it's been described as an amount which is suitable for the family's needs and includes both back payment for royalties as well as future payments.'' 007 Meets His Match Her name is Green.

''Casino Royale,'' directed by Martin Campbell and starring Daniel Craig in his debut as Bond, is expected to be released on Nov. 17. Oscar Season Brings A Screener Prosecution A California man accused of uploading a copy of the film ''Walk the Line'' that was intended for an Academy Award voter is facing a yearlong prison sentence and a $100,000 fine after he was charged with copyright infringement, The Associated Press reported. Prosecutors contend that the man, Luis Ochoa, 25, of Corona, said in an Internet chat room that he wanted to put online a special copy of the film. How he allegedly obtained the film was unclear. A chat room participant informed the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which established a bogus movie-swapping Web site where Mr. Ochoa uploaded the film on Dec. 21, according to Assistant United States Attorney Brian Hoffstadt. Mr. Ochoa could not be immediately located for comment. Catching Up With Cat and Bat People Halle Berry went to Harvard University on Thursday, and the Hasty Pudding Theatricals organization made her write ''I will not make 'Catwoman II' '' four times on a chalkboard, The Associated Press reported. Then she was given its pudding pot, signifying that the undergraduate theater group had chosen her its woman of the year. ''Catwoman,'' the 2004 film in which she played the title role, was widely regarded as one of the worst action movies of the year. In the ceremonies in Cambridge, Mass., Ms. Berry, above, who won an Academy Award for her performance in the 2001 film ''Monster's Ball,'' also danced suggestively with a Harvard student dressed as a French poodle named Dogman. Ms. Berry said she took her Hasty Pudding award ''very seriously,'' and added, ''It's going to go right next to my Oscar.'' The Batman costume worn by George Clooney in the 1997 flop ''Batman and Robin'' is going up for sale on March 31. Joe Maddalena of the auction house Profiles in History in Los Angeles, thinks the latex bodysuit, with nipples, cape, cowl, glove, bat ears and utility belt, might fetch as much as $100,000, Reuters reported. Mr. Maddalena said the costume would probably have sold for about $30,000 a few years ago, but Mr. Clooney is a lot more famous now. ''Clooney is hot,'' he said.
