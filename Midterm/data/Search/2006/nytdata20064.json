After serving five years of his sentence, he was released, but took out his anger and frustration both verbally and physically on his wife and two sons. At a time when most American animated features seem to be populated almost exclusively by superficial wisecrackers (human or otherwise), this bleak tale might seem an unlikely starting point for the animator's art.

This year's (Wednesday at 10 p.m. on ABC) is four days before the Academy Awards. And three of its four interview subjects have never even been nominated for an Oscar. MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY won a People's Choice Award this year as favorite male action star. PATRICK DEMPSEY, basking in his surprise stardom on ABC's ''GREY'S ANATOMY,'' was once nominated for an Emmy. MARIAH CAREY won the uncoveted Razzie as worst actress in her 2001 film ''GLITTER.'' So the theory must be that GEORGE CLOONEY, with three nominations (one for ''SYRIANA'' and two for ''GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK''), makes up for that. They were going to call DICK WOLF's new series ''Young Prosecutors.'' The plan is to concentrate on the personal travails of the characters -- young assistant district attorneys in New York -- more than their professional lives, which goes against everything that his ''LAW & ORDER'' franchise stands for. But when the series has its premiere on Friday (NBC, 10 p.m.), it will be called ''CONVICTION.'' Alexandra Cabot (STEPHANIE MARCH) moves from ''LAW & ORDER: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT'' to play the new bureau chief. JORDAN BRIDGES and JULIANNE NICHOLSON are her underlings. In the pilot, a senior D.A. is gunned down. After that lackluster performance at the Grammy Awards, a certain ex-Beatle needs a comeback. At least ''PAUL McCARTNEY: CHAOS AND CREATION AT ABBEY ROAD,'' a ''GREAT PERFORMANCES'' special (Monday at 10 p.m. on PBS), strives to be low key. In addition to a few LENNON-McCARTNEY hits and a few new numbers, Sir Paul, 63, sings ''HEARTBREAK HOTEL,'' hinting at how great he could have been as an Elvis impersonator.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "37", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "THE WEEK AHEAD: Feb. 26-March 4; TELEVISION"}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2006-02-26T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Arts and Leisure Desk", "section_name": "Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Anita", "lastname": "Gates"}], "original": "By Anita Gates"}, "type_of_material": "Schedule", "_id": "4fd263048eb7c8105d815926", "word_count": 285, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A04E5DD113EF935A15751C0A9609C8B63", "snippet": "THE United States' often overlooked neighbor to the north wants Americans to know there's more to Canada than moose, Mounties and mountains covered in snow.
