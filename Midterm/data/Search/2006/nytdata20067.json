Directed by Daniel Goldstein, it's a comedy about a house cat, Samantha (Emily Cass McDonnell), who finds herself torn between her affection for a human companion, a nebbishy graphic designer named Shuman (Brian Hutchison), and her attraction to a sexy tomcat, Oscar (Mario Campanaro), who invites her to sample the pleasures of the outdoor life. A neurotic pet therapist, Matilda (Keira Naughton), mediates the conflict. To assess the play's merits, I enlisted the aid of two guest commentators: Jane, 11, a flame-point Siamese, and Prudence, 12, a tabby.

The pop singer Bjork, now best known in the United States for her unusual Oscar wear (the swan dress), stars in a Dogma musical from Lars von Trier.

Jake Gyllenhaal, who through a fluke of marketing and contest machinations has been something of a forgotten man this awards season - the Bagger thinks he should get some kind of recognition for his Santa hat dance in \"Jarhead\" - acted genuinely surprised when the supporting actor award came his way. The best supporting award on the distaff side went to Thandie Newtown for her role in \"Crash\" - she may have been born in Zambia, but the British claim her as their own. Reese Witherspoon won best actress in a walk, but then, Felicity Huffman was not even up in that category. It will be fascinating to see whether Ms. Witherspoon's demure approach to Oscar campaigning - she isn't doing it - will trump Ms. Huffman's willingness to show up just about anywhere there is a podium. The Bagger is not suggesting that there is something craven in Ms. Huffman's approach; it looks less like she wants it than that she is going to enjoy every single minute of her day in the sun. And the Academy could do worse than having a 43-year-old actress at the microphone who counted a good audition as one in which her bicycle was not stolen while she was taking her turn.

As the stock car racer Elroy (Junior) Jackson, who learns to drive running moonshine for his papa through the twisting, vertiginous back roads of North Carolina, Mr. Bridges delivers the sort of seamless, unforced performance that is usually overlooked by those who bestow industry awards but that tends to linger and grow over the years. The title, like the film is based on a 1965 Esquire story, ''The Last American Hero Is Junior Johnson. Yes!'' by Tom Wolfe, once dripped with irony, but now it can be taken almost literally.
