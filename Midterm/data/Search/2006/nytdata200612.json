The movie, ''Paradise Now,'' a drama about two young men from the occupied West Bank recruited to blow themselves up in Tel Aviv, is up for the Oscar for best foreign film. It had a Palestinian crew, an Israeli producer and European financing, but it is listed by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' Web site as coming from Palestine. The film's director, Hany Abu-Assad, above, is an Israeli-born Palestinian. Yedioth Ahronoth, the Israeli newspaper, said the Israeli consulate in Los Angeles and Jewish groups were urging the academy to reconsider the national label ''given that the Palestinian Authority has yet to be declared a state,'' Reuters reported. According to the newspaper, organizers of the ceremony agreed to provide an unspecified alternative provenance for the film. The academy could not immediately be reached for confirmation yesterday. The Foreign Ministry of Israel declined to comment.

This Off Broadway version will be directed by Joe Tantalo and begin previews on March 16. Opening night is March 21, and the limited engagement is to end April 23. Godlight had a hit at 59E59 last year with an adaptation of Anthony Burgess's ''Clockwork Orange.'' The next offering at the Pearl Theater Company will be Shakespeare's ''Measure for Measure.'' Directed by Beatrice Terry with a cast including Sean McNall and Rachel Botchan, the Off Broadway production will begin previews at Theater 80 on St. Mark's Place in the East Village on Feb. 23 and open on March 5.

The hero has a strong name: Sgt. Joe Gunn (Humphrey Bogart). At least one American soldier is nicknamed for his home state or city (Bruce Bennett as Waco Hoyt). The man from France is called Frenchie (Louis Mercier). A European character is played by an American actor of a completely different ethnic background (J. Carrol Naish as Giuseppe). And there's real, heartfelt drama. This film manages to wring suspense out of the ''three swallows'' rule that applies to their very limited water supply. COP LAND (1997) Saturday at 8 p.m. on Channel 11 It's best not to think of this dark police drama as a Sylvester Stallone movie. Mr. Stallone (left) can be hard to buy as a wimpy small-town New Jersey sheriff, cowed by the New York policemen who live in his town and take police corruption to its worst possible conclusion. It's the supporting cast who make it work: Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel, Ray Liotta and a host of others, including John Spencer, the ''West Wing'' star who died last December, as one of the truly bad guys. James Mangold, who did ''Walk the Line,'' wrote and directed. CYRANO DE BERGERAC (1990) Sunday at 8 p.m., Wednesday at 8:25 a.m., and Saturday at 7:30 a.m. and 5:35 p.m. on Flix There must have been a thousand Cyranos since Edmond Rostand immortalized him in 1897, but few have captured the character's soul as G\u00e9rard Depardieu (right) does in Jean-Paul Rappeneau's film version. The story remains the same: Cyrano worships Roxane but fears her rejection because he isn't the handsomest guy in the world. In fact, he has a remarkably large nose. When Christian, a fellow guardsman, wants to woo Roxane, Cyrano helps by writing (and speaking, while unseen) beautiful words of love. Anne Brochet is Mr. Depardieu's Roxane. The devastatingly handsome Vincent Perez plays Christian. DICK (1999) Saturday at 7 p.m. on Comedy Central In Andrew Fleming's daffy satire, the real heroes of the Watergate investigation weren't the Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. They were two teenage dog walkers working for President Nixon (Dan Hedaya) at the time. The teenagers are played by Michelle Williams, now an Oscar nominee for ''Brokeback Mountain,'' and Kirsten Dunst (far left, with Ms. Williams). The supporting cast includes Dave Foley, Teri Garr, Will Ferrell (as Mr. Woodward) and Harry Shearer (as G. Gordon Liddy).", "abstract": null, "print_page": "5", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Movies", "kicker": "CRITIC'S CHOICE"}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2006-02-12T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Television", "section_name": "Movies", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Anita", "lastname": "Gates"}], "original": "By Anita Gates"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd251e48eb7c8105d7f6f3a", "word_count": 429, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/nyregion/12henry.html", "snippet": "Charles Henry joined the New York Police Department in 1951, and in his 31-year career commanded some of the city's toughest precincts during troubled times....", "lead_paragraph": "Charles O.
