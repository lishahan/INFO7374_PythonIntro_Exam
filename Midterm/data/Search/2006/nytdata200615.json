Not that he is going to go all Mensa on you, but you know what they say about idle hands. Fer instance, a while back we did a story about the scrum over credits, and now that the ballots are shipping, it's worth revisiting. On one level, the fight over who gets credit for \"Crash\" is all of the worst of Hollywood - pettiness, ego, avarice - in one untidy multi-car pileup. On another, very real issues are at stake. On one side is the Producers Guild of Anerica and, by proxy, the Academy, seeking to control credit creep, in which everybody and his brother can say they produced a film. On the other, you have people like Bob Yari and Mark Harris, two of the guys who got stiffed in the new process of determining who gets actual credit come Oscar time, wondering who appointed these guys as arbiters of all that is good and holy in the production process. As indie productions grow and become a mainstay of the both the business and the aesthetic of the industry, movies are going to continue to come together in a complicated way. Mr. Yari has already sued one of his former production partners on \"Crash,\" not just over the credit issue, but that certainly is one of the salient issues. Mr. Yari has made noises about actually going ahead and suing the Producers Guild, but that brings up a rather delicate issue. Mr. Yari continues to be financially staked in \"Crash,\" and will benefit significantly if the movie ends up sneaking in as best picture. So, with that broader objective in mind, he and anybody else involved in \"Crash\" wants to get the Academy's attention. And suing the hand that feeds them, while it will accomplish that goal, will not endear the membership when \"Crash\" needs all the friends it can get.", "abstract": "Sometimes when things slow down, the Bagger does his best thinking.

Not your great Oscar story, but pickings are slim this time of the season, and the Bagger will do what he can with what he's got. In this instance, if the pressure from Icahn were to force a de-merger, Warner Brothers, one of Hollywood's most reliable producers of tentpoles, would end up as its own darn thing, more or less. If things go that way, Warner might think about commissioning a movie called, \"It Came from Another Part of the Boardroom,\" a thinly veiled biopic of Mr. Icahn, who managed to mangle Shakespeare and misidentify his would-be compatriot Mr. Wasserstein as \"Ken.\" Mr. Wasserstein expressed significant admiration for News Corporation and Rupert Murdoch, but the gooey feeling is far from mutual.
