The bereaved parents said they had gathered more than 32,000 signatures on their petition against the drama about two West Bank friends recruited for a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv. ''It is the mission of the free world not to give such movies a prize,'' said Yossi Zur, whose teenage son Asaf died in a bus bombing. Film industry experts said that it was unheard of for an Oscar nomination to be withdrawn. Including a Jewish Israeli producer and using European financing, ''Paradise Now'' was made by an Israeli Arab director and actors, working with Palestinian crew members and locations. In January it won the Golden Globe for best foreign-language film. Shooting at Kanye West Concert Two security guards were shot at a concert given by Kanye West, right, on Tuesday night near Birmingham, England, the BBC reported. The police said that the shooting broke out after people who had tried to enter the rap event without tickets were escorted from the NEC Arena. One guard was shot in the face, stomach and foot and was in serious condition; the other was treated and released. Police officials said that the incident at Mr. West's fifth and last appearance in Britain on his Touch the Sky tour was not gang related. Detective Chief Inspector Kenny Bell of the West Midlands police said: ''Over 12,000 people were at the NEC last night. It's only one of them who decided to go out with a loaded firearm and use it in this vicious and cowardly way.'' Barbarians at the Museum A 12-year-old boy on a school visit to the Detroit Institute of Arts stuck a piece of chewing gum on Helen Frankenthaler's abstract painting ''The Bay,'' a landmark in the artist's career and a prize of the museum's collection, damaging the work, which now needs repair, The Detroit Free Press reported. Museum officials said that the painting, valued at $1.5 million, would remain on view while conservationists determined the solvent to be used to remove chemical residue about the size of a quarter. The boy has been suspended from school and his parents have taken disciplinary action. MartiniFest, a semiformal event organized by Clear Channel Radio and held at the Milwaukee Art Museum, where unlimited drinks were available for $30, left food, drink and vomit on and around some of the art by the end of the crowded party, according to people who attended or worked at the gathering, The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. One visitor said that four men stood on a bronze statue of a goddesslike woman by Gaston Lachaise and grabbed its breasts while cellphone pictures were taken. The museum said that two sculptures had been removed for ''review,'' pending the return of the senior conservator. Footnotes Illness has caused Christoph von Dohnanyi to withdraw from conducting the New York Philharmonic in concerts tonight, tomorrow, Saturday and Tuesday at Avery Fisher Hall. The orchestra announced that he would be replaced by the French conductor Ludovic Morlot, making his debut with the Philharmonic in that role. Mr. Morlot has been assistant conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra since 2004. The new production of the Pulitzer Prize- and Tony Award-winning musical ''A Chorus Line'' is to open on Broadway at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater on Oct. 5, after previews beginning Sept. 18, and a run in San Francisco from July 23 through Sept. 2 at the Curran Theater.

Jodie Foster, above, who won Academy Awards for performances in ''The Accused'' and ''The Silence of the Lambs,'' will be the speaker on May 15 at the 250th commencement of the University of Pennsylvania, The Associated Press reported. Ms. Foster, a magna cum laude graduate of Yale, is to receive an honorary doctor of arts degree.
