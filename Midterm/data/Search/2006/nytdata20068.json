When that occurs, it may become a challenge for some of photography's most venerable brands simply to survive. [Page C1.] How a Sony-BMG Management Feud Went Public A management shift at Sony BMG Music Entertainment that diminished the authority of Andrew Lack was the result of a revolt sparked by executives from the Bertelsmann side. It was a striking moment in the career arc of Mr. Lack, a longtime television news executive brought in to re-engineer Sony's flagging music unit in early 2003. In the end, some critics contend, Mr. Lack failed to shore up relationships with key players inside and outside Sony BMG, and badly undermined the confidence that had been placed in him by Bertelsmann. One result: there is new skepticism about the ability of outsiders to pull the ailing music industry out of its decline. [C1.] New Generation of Cellphones Awaits Customers American telecommunications providers have spent a combined $10 billion in the last three years to upgrade their networks to accommodate third-generation cellphones for video and music. But it remains unclear whether consumers in large numbers will want to sign up for these more advanced, and more expensive, systems. [C1.] Disney to Abandon Catalog for a Web-Only Effort The Walt Disney Company, an icon of mainstream America, will move against the grain of conventional business strategy this spring when it stops distributing a catalog that for the past decade has filled the mailboxes of tens of millions of households, and instead embarks on a Web-only initiative. ''Customers almost dictated this to us,'' said Paul Gainer, above, vice president of Disney Shopping, a division of Disney Consumer Products. ''Once they go online we just don't see them going back to the phone.'' [C4.] I.B.M. Is Set to Announce Chip-Making Advance I.B.M. researchers plan to describe an advance in chip-making that could pave the way for new generations of superchips. The advance, which comes from research in the design of advanced lenses and related technologies, will make it possible to create semiconductors with wires thinner than 30 nanometers, one-third the width in today's industry-standard chips. [C4.] Nielsen Ratings to Include College Students Nielsen Media Research announced that it would include college students living away from home in its television ratings beginning in early 2007, a move that could lift ratings on networks like Fox, MTV and the WB that cater to younger viewers. [C7.] Following the Rationale Behind Redstone's Buying If you are going to follow smart investors in the market, you had better keep a close eye on them. That is the lesson shareholders of Midway Games learned as they loaded up on the stock because the media billionaire Sumner Redstone was also buying shares. Market Place. [C1.] Lab Director's Goal: Finance the Technological Future ''My job is to live in the future 20 years from today,'' says Frank Moss, left, who was named last week as director of the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It will also be his job to keep convincing big companies to look upon the Media Lab, which was co-founded by Nicholas Negroponte, as an incubator for their future products. The Media Lab relies heavily on corporate sponsors to keep it running on an annual budget of $32 million. And it must compete for the money with other universities, like Stanford, Carnegie Mellon and CalTech, which have started similar research centers. [C4.] A Real-Life Tale of Intrigue in Hollywood Hollywood is filled with intrigue that has nothing to do with who will win the best-actor Oscar next month.
