In an updated version, Davis wouldn't drive to the nearest bar to drown her sorrows. She would go directly to Sotheby's, where her Oscar would net her a half-million or more -- enough to keep her in mink and martinis for the rest of her post-diva days. An Oscar has always been as much about commerce as about art; it ups an actor's asking price and box office appeal. These days the trophy itself can mean cold cash as a collectible, worth up to $50,000 for a ''common Oscar,'' as experts call the technical and tangential awards, and from several hundred thousand dollars to $1.5 million for those bestowed upon famous films and actors.
