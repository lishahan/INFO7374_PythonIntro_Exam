Mr. Hooker, a former politician and publisher in Tennessee, said in an interview this week that he acquired the stock for ''$1 and other valuable considerations'' after two of the four men who bought the ailing service from E.@W. Scripps Company last June relinquished their shares. The ''other considerations'' were described as his extensive contacts in the journalistic, political, entertainment and financial communities and his ability to obtain funds, if necessary, for continued operation of the news service till its losses could be overcome. Mr. Hooker's statements amounted to additional indications that Scripps turned over the news service to four new owners last year for little more than an assumption of pension obligations. All but Gave It Away, One Says One source said this week that Scripps all but gave away the news service in the original transaction. Another source, at Media News Corporation of Nashville, the new parent company of U.@P.@I., said Len R. Small and Cordell J.
