That authors believe publishers to be thieves is hardly news. Oscar Wilde claimed that ''Barabbas was a publisher.'' I can't attest to whether publishers have always cheated authors because I haven't been around that long, but I can say from personal and all-too-recent experience that authors cheat publishers: By taking money in advance and never delivering a single page of their manuscript; by running up charges which they never repay, although these are by contract clear debts; by failing to return money on contracts where the obligation for such return is clearly stated and previously agreed to; by falsifying the sales records of their previous books when trying to interest a new and different publisher in their next work; by showing their next work to a different publisher (and soliciting offers from same) when by agreement they are obliged show it to their present publisher first; by submitting phony expense accounts when on promotional tours.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "26", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "OF AUTHORS, PUBLISHERS AND GLASS HOUSES"}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "WRITING AND WRITERS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ETHICS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BOOK TRADE"}], "pub_date": "1983-03-02T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Editorial Desk", "section_name": "Opinion", "subsection_name": null, "byline": null, "type_of_material": "Letter", "_id": "4fd143f78eb7c8105d61db94", "word_count": 552, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/02/sports/gamble-doubtful-on-his-role.html", "snippet": "Oscar Gamble looks at the designated-hitter spot in the Yankee lineup and sees Don Baylor.
