The delegation, which includes a Congressman, two entertainers active in human-rights causes and several others concerned about American policy, is angry; they have seen and spoken to political prisoners who say they've been tortured, Salvadoran officials who say they are doing their best and refugees who say little but suffer a lot. The diplomat is tired. This is the 17th delegation the embassy has shepherded through the Salvadoran labyrinth during the past few weeks. ''The semiannual precertification flying circus and hootenanny,'' another embassy official calls it. ''We take as a given that this country is a horror,'' the beleaguered diplomat tells his visitors. ''There are things here which are frightening and appalling to any sensitive human being. And those of us who work in this environment and see our friends killed, murdered, tortured by one group or another are not insensitive to these things.''", "abstract": null, "print_page": "34", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "EL SALVADOR: THE STATE OF SIEGE CONTINUES"}, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "SALVADOR, EL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "VIOLENCE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ARMAMENT, DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "POLITICAL PRISONERS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CIVIL WAR AND GUERRILLA WARFARE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TERRORISM"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MILITARY PERSONNEL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FREEDOM AND HUMAN RIGHTS"}], "pub_date": "1983-02-20T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Magazine Desk", "section_name": "Magazine; Washington", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "Richard", "middlename": "J.", "lastname": "Meislin", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By Richard J.

While the Grammys, the record industry's answer to the Oscars, have yet to seize the public imagination the way its movie counterparts have done, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS), which presents the awards, has steadily grown in stature since it was formed in 1957. Academy membership, open only to individuals creatively involved in making records, has risen from a few hundred to around 3,5OO. The first awards, presented in May 1959, counted only 28 categories as compared with 62 categories this year. These include crafts awards for engineering and packaging, as well as many special awards for children's, spoken word, ethnic and comedy records. And in keeping with current trends, there's even a video category. But over the years, the Grammys have drawn sharp criticism from within and without the record industry. Because the awards have always tended to slight rock music in favor of more middle-of-theroad pop, some rock acts have boycotted the awards. And the rock press, when it has paid any attention at all to the awards, has voiced contempt for NARAS's conservative tastes in rock and jazz.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "23", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "AT 25, THE GRAMMYS EXTOL POP'S MAINSTREAM"}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "MUSIC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECORDINGS AND RECORDING EQUIPMENT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AWARDS, DECORATIONS AND HONORS"}], "pub_date": "1983-02-20T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Arts and Leisure Desk", "section_name": "Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Stephen", "rank": 1, "lastname": "HOLDEN"}], "original": "By STEPHEN HOLDEN"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd143f58eb7c8105d61da33", "word_count": 1468, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/20/nyregion/theater-playing-our-song-full-of-false-notes.html", "snippet": "ELMSFORD ''THEY'RE PLAYING OUR SONG'' is a semiautobiographical minimusical.
