The choice comes at a time when Israelis are increasingly sensitive to the way they are seen overseas. ''Hamsin'' takes examines relations between Jews and Arabs in Israel -relations that the film's director, Daniel Wachsmann, an Israeli Jew, portrays as a circle of fear, hatred and violence. The word ''hamsin'' means a hot Arabian wind that comes up from the desert. In the film, it is a metaphor for uncontrollable forces that sweep up all those in its path. In the movie, the hamsin is a wind of hate and fear that embroils both Jews and Arabs when the Government decides to take over Arab lands in a Galilee farming town. Although at first Jews and Arabs work well together, the land issue drives them apart, turning Arabs into terrorists and Jews into vigilantes and killers.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "17", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "OSCAR FILM IS CRITICAL OF ISRAEL"}, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "ISRAEL, STATE OF"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ACADEMY AWARDS (OSCARS)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ARABS"}], "pub_date": "1983-01-24T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Cultural Desk", "section_name": "Movies; Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1}], "original": "Special to the New York Times"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd12cd68eb7c8105d5f736b", "word_count": 759, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/24/arts/estelle-winwood-turning-100-feistily.html", "snippet": "On the brink of her 100th birthday Monday, Estelle Winwood tipples Gallo cream sherry, plays bridge three times a week and smokes three packs of cigarettes a day.

Wearing metallic brown brocade and a huge triangular hat, gold bracelets on both arms and black patent-leather pumps, and looking like a cross between a medieval queen and a carving of an ancient Egyptian princess, the fey and deft character actress of more than 40 Broadway plays and a score of movies sits on her sofa at noon sipping her drink. Most noons she is still asleep in her four-poster bed. The habits of a lifetime in the theater are not easily broken. She eats breakfast at 12:30 P.M., reads in bed until 3 - she is currently halfway through Kenneth Tynan's ''Show People'' - and then begins telephoning for a bridge game or an escort to take her out to dinner, perhaps to Ma Maison, the trendy French bistro across the hills from her white stucco San Fernando Valley home. She goes out most nights.

In the Theater Three production in Port Jefferson, which runs through Feb. 5, the director, George Carabin, appears to have emphasized yet another facet of Joseph Hayes's 1955 melodrama: the philosophizing, preachy part. The play, which is overwritten and underdeveloped, is, nonetheless, making a big statement about the contagion of violence and the ultimate triumph of humanity - and several smaller statements about justice, abiding by the rules, and the law.

Take, for example, Bertrand Tavernier's new French film, ''Coup de Torchon'' (translated by its distributors as ''Clean Slate''), which starts out as a conventional if exotic comedy, set in a small, parched town in French West Africa in 1938, and turns into a most provocative, wittily misanthropic melodrama set in the landscape of the soul. When we first see Lucien Cordier (Philippe Noiret), the mildmannered chief of police in Bourkassa, he seems to be a prototypical W.C. Fields character, but without Fields's saving grace of readily expressed fury at careless wives and slovenly in-laws. As Lucien moves around Bourkassa, he accepts the most outrageous insults from the other French colonials with nothing more than sheepish resignation. That which would produce rage in any other man prompts, in Lucien, an embarrassed shrug. A couple of seedy pimps pay him a bribe to overlook some minor infraction of the law and then, for laughs, dump him in the river with the bodies of black Africans who have died in a dysentery epidemic. When Lucien sees Rose (Isabelle Huppert), his pretty young mistress, being seriously beaten in the street by her husband, he cannot bring himself to help her. He assures a friend, without too much conviction, that it isn't because he's a coward but because the bystanders, knowing his relationship with Rose, would misunderstand his intervention.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "17", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "OBSCURITY AND COMEDY BLEND TO BUOY 'COUP DE TORCHON'", "kicker": "FILM VIEW"}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}], "pub_date": "1983-01-23T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Arts and Leisure Desk", "section_name": "Movies; Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Vincent", "rank": 1, "lastname": "Canby"}], "original": "Vincent Canby"}, "type_of_material": "Review", "_id": "4fd12bc78eb7c8105d5f51c6", "word_count": 1489, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/23/sports/sports-people-hayes-sets-record.html", "snippet": "No player has spent more time running up and down National Basketball Association courts than Elvin Hayes.
