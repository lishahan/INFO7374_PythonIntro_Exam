With the coming of summer and the Kool Jazz Festival, the music bursts into the concert halls and the streets, shakes the cold out of its bones and begins to strut. At least, that's been the routine in recent years. It's a routine Lehman College's first Midwinter Jazz Festival aims to shake up a bit. Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday, Benny Goodman, Stan Getz, Gary Burton, Oscar Peterson and other leading jazz musicians will be heard in two evening and three afternoon programs in the comfortable, modern concert hall and theater of Lehman College's Center for the Performing Arts. The center, on Beford Park Boulevard West in the Bronx, offers amenities of a kind not usually encountered by those out listening to jazz - buffet dining with music beginning at 5:30 P.M. today and tomorrow, for example, and free parking in an attended lot.
