A 10-second clock might have been more appropriate today for the National Basketball Association All-Star Game, in which the East defeated the West, 132-123. Julius Erving of the Philadelphia 76ers scored 25 points and was voted the most valuable player. The East's fourth consecutive victory was theater of improvisation, creative one-on-one open-floor basketball at its best. In the first period, Earvin (Magic) Johnson raced down the right side on a fast break into the lane, made a ballet move, then a full spin and a scoop shot. As the ball dropped through the hoop, Johnson was fouled by Larry Bird of the Boston Celtics and made the free throw. He finished with 17 points to go with his All-Star Game record of 16 assists, 11 in the first half. He broke Oscar Robertson's 1961 record of 14.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "EAST WINS ALL-STAR GAME"}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "PROFESSIONAL ATHLETICS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BASKETBALL"}], "pub_date": "1983-02-14T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Sports Desk", "section_name": "Sports", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Sam", "rank": 1, "lastname": "GOLDAPER"}, {"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 2}], "original": "By SAM GOLDAPER, Special to the New York Times"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd12a1e8eb7c8105d5f241e", "word_count": 1055, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/13/style/marriage-in-june-is-being-planned-by-jean-s-padjen.html", "snippet": "Mr. and Mrs. Oscar Padjen of Salem and Topsfield, Mass., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Jean Seward Padjen, to Oliver Wolcott 3d, son of Mr. and Mrs. Wolcott of Hamilton, Mass.

Generally, new plays mean high risk; classics and revivals are considered to be the crowd pleasers. However, there has been a paucity of original home-grown plays on Broadway, where the theater season is, by critical consensus, grim as well as sparse. ''Broadway has become more geared to event presentation, as opposed to plays,'' said the Hartman's executive director, Harris Goldman.

So Mr. Mpetha, who is 73 years old and infirm from a diabetes condition that could force the amputation of his left leg, was hauled back to prison Thursday at the end of the 207th day of the trial, one of the longest in the annals of South African criminal law.
