Paris still offers some of the world's most charming little hotels. Many are narrow, four-story affairs full of history and legend and sprays of fresh flowers, run by a fiercely proud owner who has dedicated his or her life to restoring, repainting and redecorating the establishment and to welcoming the assortment of international travelers who pass through the city. Many travelers hoard their carefully compiled and hard-earned ''black book'' of small Paris hotels and share the list with only the closest, most deserving friends.

When she returned, after four days, she had no idea where she had been. By now, she, too, knew that something was wrong. Over the next two years, she was subjected to periodic memory tests and physical examinations by a battery of general practitioners, gynecologists, neurologists and other physicians. Day by day, she became more disoriented. She would seem surprised at her surroundings, as if she had just appeared there. She stopped cooking, and had difficulty remembering the simplest things. Finally, in September 1981, the neurologist who by then was in charge of the case, told my sister, Margaret, what he had suspected for some time: My mother had Alzheimer's disease.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "22", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "ANOTHER NAME FOR MADNESS"}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "SENILITY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FAMILIES AND FAMILY LIFE"}], "pub_date": "1983-01-16T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Magazine Desk", "section_name": "Health; Magazine", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Marion", "rank": 1, "lastname": "Roach"}], "original": "By Marion Roach"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd12c188eb7c8105d5f616f", "word_count": 6097, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/14/us/decision-file-pet-s-doorbell-gets-a-patent.html", "snippet": "The United States Patent and Trademark Office has granted Lorin F.

At 16, he became manager of the Deauville branch of his mother's cosmetics company, and a few years later he invented a kissproof lipstick. In New York by the late 1920's, Sturges was writing for the stage.One comedy, ''Strictly Dishonorable,'' was a Broadway hit. In 1933, he went to Hollywood and wrote screenplays, both original and adapted. He pressed Paramount in 1940 to let him direct his own ''Great McGinty.'' Unexpectedly, it was a commercial and critical hit and won Sturges an Oscar for best writing. For the next four years, he was a wonder boy. Sturges's decline was as swift as his rise. In the mid-40's, he left Paramount and entered into a disastrous movie-making partnership with the industrialist Howard Hughes from which he never recovered. Sturges's films began drawing mixed reviews and smaller audiences, and were losing a lot of money. Next, he bought and managed the Players, an early dinner-theater in Hollywood that went broke.
