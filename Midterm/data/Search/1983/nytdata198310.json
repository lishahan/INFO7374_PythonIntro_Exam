But they estimated that sales in the 1982 retailing year, which concludes at the end of January, would fall 1 percent from the previous year. Addressing about 1,500 participants at a morning meeting of the annual convention of the National Retail Merchants Association at the New York Hilton Hotel, Robert A. Mooney, manager of corporate economics for the J.C. Penney Company, declared: ''After a 1 1/2 percent gain in 1982, general merchandise retail sales will be up 6 1/4 percent in 1983. Price inflation will account for just over 3 percent of these gains, leaving 3 percent real growth.''", "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "RETAILERS, AT MEETING, PREDICT 2-3% SALES GAIN"}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "SALES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FORECASTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CONVENTIONS AND CONFERENCES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CONSUMER BEHAVIOR"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RETAIL STORES AND TRADE"}], "pub_date": "1983-01-11T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Financial Desk", "section_name": "Business", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Isadore", "rank": 1, "lastname": "BARMASH"}], "original": "By ISADORE BARMASH"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd12cd78eb7c8105d5f73ad", "word_count": 679, "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/09/nyregion/new-blasts-show-faln-resilience.html", "snippet": "Through eight years of bombings and other violent actions, a small Puerto Rican armed force known as the F.A.L.N. has established itself as one of the most elusive and resilient terrorist groups ever to operate in the United States, according to F...", "lead_paragraph": "Through eight years of bombings and other violent actions, a small Puerto Rican armed force known as the F.A.L.N. has established itself as one of the most elusive and resilient terrorist groups ever to operate in the United States, according to Federal and local law enforcement officials. The officials, who include Lee F. Laster, assistant director in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in New York City, say that the F.A.L.N. -Fuerzas Armadas de Liberacion Nacional, or Armed Forces of National Liberation - remains a threat out of proportion to its size and lack of support in Puerto Rico and among Puerto Ricans on the mainland. A mark of its resilience, officials say, is its obvious resurgence less than three years after the arrest and subsequent conviction of 11 men and women charged with plotting and carrying out dozens of bombings and other crimes for the F.A.L.N. in Chicago and New York in the 1970's. The 11 were arrested on April 4, 1980, in Evanston, Ill., during what one later called preparation for an armored-car robbery.

The men and women - young and old, white and black - come from a variety of backgrounds.

As temperatures drop, they leave their usual haunts and look for a warm spot to spend the night. The 12-by-60-foot trailer, which was opened just a month ago, provides a spartan, overnight shelter for the homeless.
